The bar opened directly to the outdoors, and would have been popping at this moment, had not the clientele families to return to. The striped awning that hung over the stools read “FLOPPA’S.” Couched in the inviting glow that signified rest and safety stood a lanky caracal in a purple robe. Despite his ostentatious ears and the alternating hues of black and beige that adorned his face like clown makeup, he forced a perpetually serious and dignified countenance.</p><p>“Floppa, Floppa! I have something to show you!” hailed Finn as he towed the stumbling salamander behind. </p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“We have a visitor, but he’s from Down Below! Please introduce yourself to my friend, Mister Lizard.”</p><p>The salamander waved timidly and said, “I’m Axl. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Floppa’s my name, if you couldn’t already tell. What can I get for you?”</p><p>Axl sat in silence for a couple seconds because he wasn’t presented with a complete list of options. “Do you have, umm, water?”</p><p>Floppa furrowed his brow and turned to Finn. “Is your friend slow? Or is he one of those clean living types?”</p><p>Finn responded, “He’s in shock because the world turned out to be much bigger than he imagined, and he’s still recovering from a wolfbear attack!”</p><p>“Did he poke one in the eye or something?” Floppa chuckled, thinking, <i>I should poke Finn in the eye. That wouldn’t be hard to do.</i> Then he turned around and filled two pints. “How is Finn treating you, Axl? Is he keeping you as a pet?”</p><p>“No,” Axl replied. “He fed me and took me to the town, and I couldn’t get him his medicine, but he wasn’t even mad about it.”</p><p>“That’s lovely.” He delivered their drinks. “Humor me for a while. I want to know how Bluebloods go about their day. You live in the city that’s ruled by a computer, right?”</p><p>“No,” said Axl. Nobody ruled anyone in Yammi’s city.</p><p>“But there is a giant computer down there.”</p><p>“When I need to compute something, I go to Yammi for help.”</p><p>“And what do you do for fun down there?”</p><p>“We fuck!” Axl shouted matter-of-factly, as though he were answering the teacher’s cue in a rote memorization exercise. “Well, not me, but-”</p><p>He yipped and jumped out of his stool moments later. Four red bands had been left on his side. “Watch your language, Mister Lizard!” Finn snapped. </p><p>Meanwhile, Floppa failed to contain his laughter, and rested against the wall, head in arms. “Bluebloods have such a way with words,” he remarked. “They’re very funny...until you have to live with them!” Then he laughed even harder.</p><p>The two mammals asked Axl more questions about life Down Below, laughing at his responses each time, and they exchanged playful banter. After a while, however, Floppa fell silent. He was ingesting every detail of Axl’s physiognomy - the dusty pink color, the beady eyes, and the gorgeous fronds that flanked his head. </p><p>“Finn,” he finally said, “you told me this thing was a lizard, but he’s not a lizard at all.”</p><p>“He’s not?”</p><p>“No. He doesn’t have scales.”</p><p>“Then he is a scaleless lizard.”</p><p>“You dunce! He’s a salamander, and more precisely, a - oh, what are they called? - an axolotl.”</p><p>“That’s impossible,” Finn cried. They were both staring at Axl and making him uneasy.</p><p>“He fits the description perfectly.”</p><p>“But that would mean...surely he knows.”</p><p>“I highly doubt it.”</p><p>Finn set his drink down and placed his paw on Axl’s knee, asking, “Axolotl friend, do you know who your parents are?”</p><p>Axl did not know how to answer. He only understood the word ‘parent’ in the most abstract sense, as in the progenitor node in a data structure. </p><p>“Where were you born, Axl?” asked Floppa.</p><p>“The Cocoon.”</p><p>“To whom?”</p><p>“There was a fish in the bag next to me. We were born at the same time. He was the first person I ever saw.” Axl stated his answer proudly, but cowered shortly after, knowing that it was insufficient.</p><p>“Shall I break the news?” Finn said.</p><p>“That would upset him greatly.”</p><p>“But he ought to know!”</p><p>“Then go ahead, but if he refuses to speak again out of angst, then you have only yourself to blame.”</p><p>“I accept the blame!” Finn cried, and he devoted his attention to the salamander, who was both curious and apprehensive about the oncoming revelation. “There has not been an axolotl on Earth for thousands of years. They all died off. You are probably the last of your kind.”</p><p>“What’s an axolotl?” Axl said.</p><p>“You! You are!”</p><p>“I’m the only one?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Have you ever encountered a pink lizard with tufts on his head?”</p><p>“No. People say I look unique and special.” Axl wanted to know how a kind could “die off” in a world where individuals could change their forms at will. “How did the Axolotls die off?” he asked. “Why am I the only one?”</p><p>“Now you’re asking the right questions, Mister Li- I mean Axolotl. Listen as I recount the history of your people.”</p><p>“Please don’t do what I think you’re going to do,” said Floppa.</p><p>“Pull down your ears if you hate it so much!”</p><p>Floppa did so, and creature broke out into the following rhyme:</p><div class="quote-block"><br/><p>Enclosed by white-capped ridges spitting fire,</p><p>To placid lakes a gentle race retired.</p><p>Under the mirror-like surface they dwelled.</p><p>With pleasant smiles their swishing tails propelled</p><p>Their slender bodies through the waters clear</p><p>In innocent games they played without fear.</p><p>Within their aquatic gardens they’d rest,</p><p>By sublime inebriation possessed.</p><br/><p>On dry, dangerous land their cousins roamed.</p><p>But the axolotls so loved their home.</p><p>Forever young, they enjoyed with pride</p><p>The sustenance that their lake did provide,</p><p>And to the naysayers on the hard plain,</p><p>They shook their lavish gills like lion’s mane.</p><p><i>Our paradise is eternal!</i> they thought.</p><p>This maxim each generation was taught.</p><br/><p>But the amphibians’ glee would end.</p><p>Their habitat a savage race would rend.</p><p>Humans the fiends were called, and they cared not</p><p>For the beauty of their Earthly lot.</p><p>They disperse like a purifying flame,</p><p>Cremating all - agents of Death untamed,</p><p>Who by nature are compelled to defile</p><p>The virgin land with their conquest vile.</p><br/><p>The heartless beasts descended on the creeks</p><p>And persecuted the denizens meek,</p><p>Battered by boats and stabbed by hook and spear,</p><p>And served on carts, and held in vessels drear.</p><p>Imagine yourself one of these poor souls</p><p>Taken away from your resplendent shoal</p><p>And held captive in a human’s hard grasp,</p><p>Your torso crushed and unable to gasp.</p><br/><p>He opens his terrible cavity</p><p>And with foul stench blows dispassionately</p><p>The gaseous remains of your dear mother</p><p>And father onto your writhing body,</p><p>And sucks your limbs and grinds your supple flesh,</p><p>Between their yellow teeth your gore enmeshed.</p><p>Your pitiful squeals are heard but ignored,</p><p>Lost in the noisome chatter of the horde.</p><br/><p>The few humans whose hearts were not subdued</p><p>By indifference to the suffering multitudes,</p><p>Who cried “These creatures we mustn’t devour,”</p><p>Also said, “Here we shall establish our</p><p>Aquarius, our Empire of Dust.</p><p>A home for everyone! Do not mistrust</p><p>Our rule. To our pink comrades we take heed.</p><p>Love for all creatures is our sacred creed.”</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, they planned devastations covert,</p><p>Involving senseless upheavals of dirt.</p><p>Without restraint, the beasts emptied the lakes,</p><p>Imprisoning the innocuous race</p><p>To narrow streams which-in they dumped their waste.</p><p>Entombed in trash and cement was their place</p><p>Of attachment by rainbow chords effaced</p><p>From memory. Their place became no-place.</p><br/><p>Many decades passed in this forlorn state.</p><p>Never did the humans anticipate</p><p>When the last axolotl would be seen</p><p>Shrouded in shadow by hovels obscene,</p><p>Wavering in the everlasting dusk</p><p>Of pollution, witnessing murders brusque</p><p>Of friends and family taken from the mire.</p><p>He now settles down gently to expire.</p><br/><p>In eons Saturn’s whirling storms shall swill</p><p>The planet’s delicate bracelets until</p><p>Their splendor is expunged from this wide world,</p><p>Irreproducible from the fine words</p><p>Of poets, or by brush or photograph.</p><p>The same is true of creatures who once laughed</p><p>Carefree but whose visages are now gone.</p><p>To see, to hear, to lay your hand upon</p><p>Them is out of the question for now on,</p><p>To legend their magnificence withdrawn.</p><p>But axolotls are different somehow,</p><p>For I am sitting next to one right now!</p><br/></div><p>“Where did you find that poem?” asked Floppa.</p><p>“I made it up on the spot,” Finn replied.</p><p>“No you didn’t. You&#x27;re lying.”</p><p>“I did! I’m very creative. I talk to muses and such.”</p><p>“Reducing the agony of an entire species to a tasteless ditty. You ought to be ashamed. Give up poetry forever! If only you had unpretentious interests, like fishing or woodworking. And axolotls are not innocuous; they’re cannibals. He’s probably the only one left because he gobbled up the last female. And furthermore, the axolotls got what they deserved for allowing the humans to conquer them.”</p><p>“Don’t say that!” Finn exclaimed.</p><p>“I’ll say what I want, because they are the facts! You’re so wrapped up in your books and magic, you little intellectual, that they blind you to the truths of the everyday - those hard truths that stare you right in the face once you’ve raked off the dirt of convention and superstition. So the humans were a ‘purifying flame’ that ‘dispersed’ onto the lake. Would it have been better if one man subjugated the axolotls instead of millions? At all times we seek to usurp each other. In that respect, the axolotls were no better than the humans. Whom did they displace when they first settled in that dirty pond? What made their conquest noble and that of the humans repugnant? The axolotls also had every opportunity to beat back the humans, but they bumbled around like drunkards instead. Life is a game of power, and I don’t pity the losers, like one would a deformed child who receives false compliments.”</p><p>“The axolotls were pretty,” Finn said.</p><p>“Pretty! Last week you told me, ‘Let the little girls say, to be good is what is pretty.’ And you got that nugget of wisdom from the same race you lambasted not two minutes ago. I suppose you’ll read another book that says, ‘Walk like a crab,’ and that will be your philosophy for the week. In any case, perhaps the axolotls were one of those things ‘ripe for destruction,’ hmm? See, I read books, too! What good is pretty when ‘the horde’ moseys onto your shores? Shall we punish folk for the crime of being ugly? You’re not a heartbreaker yourself, you little gremlin. Never reproduce!”</p><p>Finn countered, “You think you know it all, kitty cat, but you can’t see five feet in front of you! Intellectual you call me, but it is you who are wrapped up in words and theories, proclaiming ‘This is what life is’ with such assurance.”</p><p>“In other words,” Floppa said, “I use reason to reach my conclusions, whereas you pull them out from under your tail!”</p><p>The mammals bickered for some time, reverting to their expressive language of chirps and warbles. Floppa slammed his paws on the counter. Finn stood up on the stool and bared his teeth. The two growled at each other and rubbed their heads together, raring for a fist fight.</p><p>Floppa then addressed Axl in a common tongue. “Don’t let this goober’s cute words and womanish sentimentalism fool you. He’s a tyrant and a sociopath, and a little ball of hatred. Why does he love poetry? Because he hates the world, and he thinks he can compose a better one. Go on, Finn, tell your pet what you plan to do once you leave the Woods.”</p><p>“I’d rather hear what Axl thinks of all this,” Finn said. “And I’m not womanish. I’m a manly man.”</p><p>Axl was put on the spot again. He did not know what to think, but he imagined one of the humans’ barbed hooks impaling his fragile body, and felt sympathy for his ancestors, first as anguish and then as righteous billowing fury.</p><p>“Why did the humans do that?” he asked, sweating.</p><p>“Because they could not help themselves,” Finn replied. “Humans are the most debased creatures on Earth. People say their closest cousins are monkeys, but I think they look more like hippos. Have you ever wondered why they have square teeth? It’s because when they don’t eat axolotls, they eat leaves and grass instead, like farm animals!”</p><p>“And they killed children, too?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>So many things did Axl not yet comprehend: why the axolotls all congregated in the same place, why they didn’t just change their forms to evade capture, why the humans went after them in particular, and why Finn had even related this tale of people that Axl did not know. Nevertheless, hatred churned in his heart, and he felt compelled to pick up a rock and bash the head of the next human he saw. But then he recalled the only human with whom he was acquainted - Damien! Did that schlubby, flamboyant man belong to the same stock that murdered his kin? What makes humans so bloodthirsty, and why does Yammi let people change into them? These questions and more swirled in Axl’s head, and he couldn’t give a definitive statement about anything. In a strange way, Axl felt responsible for his people’s extermination, as though he could have stretched his arm through time and prevented the whole tragedy.</p><p>Seeing that Axl had become silent and morose, the mammals steered the conversation onto more lighthearted things. They continued to question him about life Down Below and laugh at his strange answers, and Floppa made sure to feign disinterest with his sardonicism.</p><p>As the three were about to part, Floppa pulled Finn aside and whispered, “You’re going to send him back, right?”</p><p>“I’ll have him do menial work around the town,” Finn whispered back.</p><p>“He couldn’t hammer a nail without your supervision.”</p><p>“Neither can you, kitty, with those puffy paws of yours!”</p><p>The little creature and his salamander pet left the tavern in the blue glow of the night. They walked to where there were no lights, and Finn yanked Axl’s arm, asking, “Do you want to see another magic trick?”</p><p>But as soon as Axl could say yes, he was gone. The salamander spinned around a few times and called Finn’s name, and paced in circles, thinking that he had been abandoned forever. Just as he resolved to run back to Floppa and tell him of his missing companion, two clawed hands appeared from behind and tickled his sides. He jumped a mile into the air and landed squarely on his back. Meanwhile, the creature was laughing so intensely that he could hardly stand himself. Axl didn’t know whether to take this prank as an incitement of some kind, but Finn was compassionate, and helped him off the ground.</p><p>“You can turn invisible!” Axl said.</p><p>“No, not quite,” Finn replied. “With magic, you can go anywhere!”</p><p>They returned to the treehouse. Axl was about to stumble across the hanging bridge, back into the circular chamber, but Finn tugged his arm again. “Oh, the bed you slept in last night was actually mine. Please sleep on the couch tonight.” Finn led Axl to the living room and lit some candles so that everything was a dim and cozy orange.</p><p>Axl flopped his belly onto the sofa so that he looked like a giant blobfish. His tail overhung from the edge, and he held it rigid so as not to swipe objects from the adjacent nightstand. Finn snuffed out the candles and allowed the delicate starlight from the window to carry Axl to sleep.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/xi"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/ix"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/x#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/x","query":{},"buildId":"KxiilUVczCABOq9PQU3vF","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
