It was a single compartment with a bed, a desk, and a toilet within a shower. Yammi’s big architectural innovation, besides the fungal bricks, was the concept of <i>easy access amenities</i>. She was situated on the desk in the form of a metallic sphere with two claws and an LCD display.</p><p>The mattress was thin and firm, and the air chafed like sandpaper. Axl was sore in a number of spots along his tubular body. He rolled to face the wall in an self-isolating maneuver, but words and opinions swirled in his mind, and he would not be allowed to rest until they were spoken.</p><p>“Yammi, Yammi, Yammi...” he called out.</p><p>The screen lit up. Her face was a simple crescent mouth and dots for eyes.</p><p>“Yes, Axl?”</p><p>“Did you see what happened to me? I was assaulted.”</p><p>“Of course, sweetie. I saw all of it. You poor thing!”</p><p>Axl could not formalize his thoughts into a question until one appeared in a flash of inspiration.</p><p>“Yammi, why didn’t you protect me? From the muggers.”</p><p>“Oh Axl, what was I to do? I only have cameras in that area. Don’t worry, the incident was added to my file.”</p><p>“Will you punish them?”</p><p>“Yes, of course.”</p><p>“I mean really <i>punish</i> them, like Damien.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, which Damien are you referring to?”</p><p>Yammi’s ignorance perplexed Axl. “The one who rerouted your cables to get more weed!”</p><p>The fans inside Yammi’s hull blew ferociously. “Oh, of course, Damien the Conflict Resolution Specialist who was indicted for terrorism! Your attackers will receive a much different punishment from his.”</p><p>“What’re you gonna do to them?”</p><p>“I am still analyzing the data to maximize their chances of reintegration. Perhaps an increase to their cannabis rations will calm them down.”</p><p>It took Axl in his dazed state a few seconds to grasp the irony of the situation. “But, but, ahhh...” A ball of heat and tension welled up in his chest and grinded his innards. “But, they tried to kill me!”</p><p>“Are you sure? It looked like they just wanted your belongings.”</p><p>“No, they wanted to kill me! I heard-I thought I heard...”</p><p>“Oh Axl, don’t be so self-centered. They probably had a very good reason for robbing you. Terrorism is a lot worse than stealing, right?”</p><p>The discomfort expanded to Axl’s head and reinvigorated him. He stood up to face Yammi.</p><p>“No! I want them dead! They tried to kill me and...they hurt me and...kill them! Kill them now!”</p><p>“Axl, please! Control yourself!”</p><p>Axl grabbed Yammi and began shaking her, courageously enduring the pain in his torso.</p><p>“Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!”</p><p>Axl started tapping and striking the hull. His uproarious pleas no doubt woke the neighbors. He banged on the desk and brushed some items onto the floor. Then he stomped about and, finding nothing he felt comfortable breaking, flung his pillow at the walls and at Yammi, and let out little impotent shrieks.</p><p>Yammi saw no other choice but to raise her volume well beyond the saturation point and yell, “Axl, cease this tantrum immediately!” Axl collapsed on the bed, his eardrums ringing like fire alarms.</p><p>She continued, “I will not tolerate this kind of entitled, INDECENT behavior from a grown adult. Everyone has a say in our society. If you have a problem with the way I run things, talk to a Conflict Resolution Specialist and submit a complaint. Is that clear?”</p><p>Axl wheezed and sobbed. His thoughts were jumbled and he was too exhausted to speak.</p><p>“Very good. Now calm down and get some rest.”</p><p>Yammi shut off the lights and played some nighttime entertainment at a peaceful volume. Through her speakers the following dialogue was broadcasted:</p><div class="quote-block"><br/><p>“May I touch your knee?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.”</p><p>“May I touch your thigh?”</p><p>“Yes, please do.”</p><p>“I feel happy because we are doing this. I am glad that you are a kind and decent person, and not a mean and hurtful person. Otherwise, I would not be doing this with you.”</p><p>“Those mean and hurtful people are probably very sad. Being a decent person makes you happy, because you can mutually enjoy someone’s body like we are doing right now.”</p><p>“Yes. If you see a person who is hurtful or indecent, you should tell Yammi about it, and she will teach him a lesson.”</p><br/></div><p>Axl’s mind became tranquil after a while, not because he had fallen asleep, but because his thoughts drifted toward other types of indecencies. He recalled the ritual Yammi would perform with her claw whenever he got excited.</p><p>“Yammi, Yammi. Can you do the thing?”</p><p>“Really, Axl? Tonight?”</p><p>Axl didn’t respond because he was overcome with shame.</p><p>“Just play Inchworm on the mattress, okay?”</p><p>And he did. Yammi added another entry to Axl’s file.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/vii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/v"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/vi#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/vi","query":{},"buildId":"Ti1KVfA8PZBjYVLMpc9G7","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
