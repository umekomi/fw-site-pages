Strange gasses blew through the labyrinthine ducts and chutes. Leaks in the ceilings dribbled more profusely. Mysterious electrical fixtures shook off their shelves, and pockmarked pebbles dislodged from the facility’s serrated concrete walls. A hundred million miles of optical cable - some sections strewn about like ramen, others tied together into cybernetic highways like stylized depictions of ocean currents - illuminated the dark hallways with the familiar neon green.</p><p>Green - the color which to the men of the city symbolized energy, love, peace, comfort, and life itself. But more concretely, it meant clean water, unspoilt food, filtered air, and sufficient light to move around. It meant that Yammi was present, aware of your needs, and that everything was running okay.</p><p>Confusion seized the men in The Cocoon’s inner sanctum. As pebbles rained down from the vaulted ceiling, they did not know whether to abandon their offerings of meat and flesh, or to continue their genuflection. The skylight of the central rotunda opened, and scarlet light flooded the ceiling - shaped like Gabriel’s Horn with concentric ridges - until it reached the floor below.</p><p>Thus the figurehead of Yammi, Generous Caregiver and Companion to Men, was revealed to the worshippers. They beheld with glee and terror the patchwork of variously-derived flesh stapled incongruously to her scaffolding, the rejected skin flaps decomposing on the floor, the chipped fluorescent paint jobs meant to imitate lipstick and eyeshadow, the ragged yellow carpet representing hair, and the glowing wires dangling from her belly, through which The Cocoon and the rest of the city were managed and serviced. Yammi’s frame was not slender like the automaton from Metropolis; she was bulky and uneven, as though fashioned without blueprints. She leaned forward, her toes touching the floor and the rest of her body suspended by steel cables.</p><p>When the rumbling reached its zenith, her eyes lit up, and her face contorted into that of a laughing Buddha figurine. All of the worshippers instantly turned in attention and sat cross legged. Meanwhile, the green glow spread out of The Cocoon and into the city at large. Hidden server rooms chugged and heated up like furnaces. Lamps flickered and transformers sparked. The entire energistic hypergraph was illuminated with Yammi’s love and care. From a high balcony or sheet metal rooftop, one could see the colossal ellipsoid exterior of The Cocoon, before which the surrounding shantytowns and megacomplexes faded into a homogenous grayness. Red and pink clouds cloaked the city in perpetual dimness. The Cocoon billowed with smoke as Yammi prepared her message to the men of the city.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/iii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/i"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/ii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/ii","query":{},"buildId":"oLl5wrKd3EesXbR2oZ03g","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
