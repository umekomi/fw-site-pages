Before his eyes there were no shapes or objects, but the petrified black tendrils of a long-deceased goliath, made rugged by erosion; by his feet, a firm green carpet draped upon lumpy ground.</p><p>“Yammi, Yammi, Yammi...,” Axl called. No response.</p><p>After many minutes of questioning, <i>What am I supposed to do?</i> he gathered the courage to turn his head. There was no goliath. Axl was in the central enclosure of a vast temple, surrounded by great black columns reaching steadfast toward the heavens. The array of pillars swallowed by mist clouds, within which Axl manned an orb of negative space, supported a high verdant canopy. Specks of sunlight shone as if through loosely stitched fabric. The goliath’s entrails were the columns’ thick roots, which dispersed from the trunk and bore toward the Earth’s center. Around the trunks wound vines from which flowers sprung, whose petals, lighter than stray hairs, bore every austere, unpretentious color that was gentle to the eye. Axl did not know what to call this place, nor half of the forms he laid his eyes upon. After more deliberation, he resolved to stand up. He even dared to walk around.</p><p>Absolute stillness - not even an insect’s footstep nor splash of water droplet broke the silence. If any intelligent life existed here, a single thought of theirs would overshadow the arc of human advancement from cave dwelling to skyscraper, and their presence would be known only by the slight bend of saplings as they rose. Axl felt like a great nuisance as leaves crunched under his feet. He was trespassing in a home of giants.</p><p>Slowly, toe to heel, he wandered about the primordial Woods. The mists rendered his path invisible. The terrain dipped and climbed without regard for his convenience. The boulders embedded in the soil formed steps too high for his tiny legs to overcome.</p><p>The usual rationalizations ran through his mind: <i>This is all a dream. The test will end soon.</i> As we have already seen, Axl’s thoughts carry him to dark places whenever he is alone. Now, Axl had not even the walls of his apartment to snuggle him. The Woods cared not for his safety, both mental and physical. It provided no rescuer whenever a dunce happened to wander in. Axl worried, <i>What if I was never supposed to leave the spot on the carpet?</i> But it was too late; he had lost his way. What’s more, his stomach began to growl. <i>Yammi isn’t here to bring me food!</i></p><p>He quickened his pace. There must be a safe place somewhere. A shelter where his basic needs would be met, where a friend would be waiting, and where he could take a nap. But the Forest never ended, and it was getting dark. Shrubbery scraped against his delicate skin and his ankles bashed into rocks. He let out dramatic wails each time which were heard by no one. Every attempt to sprint petered into a tired, breathless stroll.</p><p>The densest, most desolate blackness descended upon the Forest. Not a single beam of tenuous moonlight pierced the canopy. The whole universe had gone cold and inert. Axl was blind and he had not yet found shelter. His only option was to lean against the nearest tree and, by rolling to and fro and flailing his limbs across the ground, fish for fallen leaves and shrubbery with which to cover himself. The night was cool and Axl did not sleep easily. The blackness let the percolating colors of visual snow flourish in his eyes. Just as Axl surrendered to the slurring thoughts of near-sleep, a distant howl echoed throughout the dark. Needles shot from toe to gill. Never had he felt so naked.</p><p>Axl spent the subsequent days stumbling about the Woods, refusing to eat even berries and dandelions, for he could not discern edible from poisonous. He hardly drank because the water came trickling on rocks rather than served in plastic cups. Each evening shrouded him in yet thicker clouds of delirium. He could not tell left from right, nor uphill from downhill. Night was spent shivering under brambles, anticipating the moment the roaring would greet his hideout and Axl would be no more.</p><p>On the third sunrise, Axl, wheezing and hunched over, lips cracked like the Atacama, tongue searching for the last traces of moisture, happened upon a miraculous sight. The mists parted, revealing a crowd of fireflies buzzing and blinking in meter. Each time Axl ran into them, they scattered and recombined elsewhere. They led him to a clearing where yellow sun rays bore down on a carpet of waving grass. In the center stood a regal stag with a snow-white coat and thick golden antlers. Its cool gaze, large stature, and princely countenance demanded veneration. It looked sternly in Axl’s direction and with a thunderous sound shot hot air from its nostrils.</p><img src="/img/fw_old/stag.png" style="width:50%"/><p>Axl cowered behind a bush, believing that the stag did not see him, but it beckoned him hither in a low, distinguished voice: “How courageous you are, bald one, for sleeping without a roof over your head.”</p><p>Axl tiptoed over, afraid to look at its eyes or at its shining headpiece.</p><p>“Come,” said the stag. It led Axl to a short tree, tore off a strange object with its mouth, and plopped it in Axl’s hands.</p><p>“Eat.” It was an apple. Axl hesitantly surveyed its skin with his tongue. Seeing that the stag was getting impatient, he closed his eyes and bit slowly. It tasted watery and sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.</p><p>“Follow that stream downward.” The stag raised a hoof in its direction. “There you’ll find someone to take you in.”</p><p>“Yammi?” asked Axl, still in a haze of delirium.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Oh...I want Yammi.”</p><p>“You won’t find her here.”</p><p>Axl’s heart dropped, for as far as he knew, Yammi was his only salvation from this strange and deadly habitat.</p><p>“Can you come with me?”</p><p>“I will watch you.”</p><p>“Damien?”</p><p>“No. Please go. The sun is setting.”</p><p>The stag galloped into the blue fog. Axl took a few more apples and obeyed its command. The stream deposited into a river, which widened until fog obscured the opposing bank. Axl’s stomach was still an empty vessel. He ate all of the fruit, even their bitter stems.</p><p>Night fell again. The mists receded, and the trees flanking the river shined with the full force of the moon’s ethereal beams. Millions of pinprick lights dotted heaven’s vault, unobstructed by smog or bloom from human activity. Axl peeked his head over the riverbank and perceived the soft yellow glow of a far-off settlement.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Axl’s mind was deadset, committed to a singular goal, instead of wavering between fears and embarrassing memories. The distant lantern light inspired a unified happiness, uncorrupted by the recurring anxieties of back home. He was an integrated personality, secure in himself. But this stability would abruptly end. The howling returned, and it was louder this time. </p><p>Axl froze. The noises didn’t cease. They only crept closer. Axl bargained that he could become one with the Forest, but he was mistaken. He turned his head toward the rustling of foliage. Behind tall grass appeared a long snout, sneering and snarling, rugged and matted and caked with mud, and baring white fangs like wooden stakes. The beast’s hunter eyes were narrow and yellow, and betrayed the singular and all-consuming lust for murder. It stepped forward to reveal its large, swelling torso. This was some wicked aberration of a wolf, scruffy and muscle-bound and covered in engorged lumps, like the result of selective breeding gone wrong. </p><p>The seething monster began its lunge and Axl tripped backward. Too late was his reaction, for the beast’s fearsome row of spikes effortlessly pierced his arm. He was now its captive. It pulled like it was playing tug-of-war, and yanked its head around as dogs do with small prey. Axl was too caught off guard to scream. He leaned backward, and the counteracting force stretched and ripped his frail appendage until it was held only by stringy white tendons. With a final tug, the arm dislodged from its socket, and the rest of Axl plunged into the river.</p><p>The water was deep and opaque with sediment. Axl flailed and somersaulted in the depths until the shock of the attack waned, after which he was blessed by an epiphany. He did not need to come up for air. He pulsed his gills back a few times; they provided all the oxygen he needed. In fact, he was much more maneuverable in the water than on land. He wiggled his tail, and that provided the necessary propulsion. Lucky for him, because the beast had too entered the depths. But the wolf’s doggy paddles were no match for Axl’s God-given, hydrodynamic design. </p><p>Axl saw the beast fade behind, as well as bits of white flesh trailing from his exposed socket. He continued underwater until he reached the warm glow of his safe haven above. Only as he surfaced did the adrenaline wear off, and the pain of his injury became excruciating. He flopped on a low dock, writhing and moaning and hyperventilating. He did not complete the final crawl toward dry land.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/fw_old/ix"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/fw_old/vii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/writing"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/fw_old/viii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/fw_old/viii","query":{},"buildId":"Xo3LsHYNaAUMTxkA3Fqks","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
