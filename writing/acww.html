It is the prelude to an adult fairy tale of sorts. None of the views expressed herein are my own.</p><div id="ch1" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="i-">I.</h2><p>Axl was always loved by his teachers. Respectful, attentive, considerate, upright-sitting, never disruptive, never saying hurtful things nor using violence against his fellow students. He was special. He was a little grown-up!</p><p>All of the boys were seated in a circle. An elliptical hull hung from the ceiling by slack wires and a thin steel arm. The PA system uttered a raspy tone, and the wires glowed neon green. The oculus on the hull opened, revealing a dome of matte, slimy plastic. Rhythmic clapping emanated from Yammi, or Ms. Y, as she liked to be called in the classroom.</p><p>“Good morning, my little ducklings!”</p><p>Tracks on the ceiling let her navigate to the center of the circle, liquid discharge trailing behind. The dome sculpted itself into a human face: gentle, with a round jaw, big lips, and puffy cheeks. Her countenance was a ray of unwavering gaiety. Of course, the boys continued to chat, exchanging obscene jokes which Axl neither understood nor was comfortable hearing. A few had already left their seats and examined the slime that had accumulated in the corners of the room.</p><p>“Boys, boys! Class has started. Do I need to sound my alarm?” The chatter died down marginally.</p><p>Once seated mute, arms crossed tightly, the tiny salamander sprung up in agitation and blurted, “Fwends, Yammi’s tuhned awn! Hey, ewybawdy listen!” He was careful not to use the phrase <em>shut up,</em> for which he was sternly lectured the last time one of these outbursts occurred. The class eventually settled into whispers, which escaped detection by the room’s microphone array but could nonetheless be heard by the students.</p><p>“Thank you, Axl. You know how to deal with these gremlins better than I do!” She added an entry to her database, documenting Axl’s failure to modulate his voice. &quot;We&#x27;re picking up from yesterday&#x27;s lesson. <em>You Phrases</em> versus <em>I Phrases</em> - can someone tell us what the difference is and which one we should use when we&#x27;re <em>really</em> angry at someone?&quot;</p><p>The few pupils who heard Yammi&#x27;s request would not dare answer, for they did not want to expedite the lesson. But to no one&#x27;s surprise, <em>someone&#x27;s</em> hand shot up.</p><p>“Axl, can you enlighten us?” She swiveled in his direction, a feature later removed as it was deemed too confrontational.</p><p>After scouring every chamber of his mental palace, the pink tadpole began: “Well, it&#x27;s about, about how you, how you gotta wespect and how, how society, and people, like, makes you do things, and you gotta, like, it makes you do things you they become pawt of who you awe but they awen&#x27;t.”</p><p>Axl half-grinned and resumed his self-soothing posture. There were no desks because there were no materials to bring, and this left Axl’s pink, supple body exposed and undefended. Giggles broke from the whispering, to which his black caviar eyes darted anxiously.</p><p>&quot;Oh, Axl,&quot; said Yammi with a tragic intonation, &quot;that&#x27;s not quite right. But that&#x27;s okay, you&#x27;ll get it next time. I believe in you!&quot; She addressed the bored children: &quot;Maybe an example will help clear things up. When your partner steals your <em>favorite</em> toy, do you say, &#x27;You stole my favorite toy!&#x27; or, &#x27;I feel very hurt because you stole my favorite toy?&#x27;&quot; She used drastically different intonations to differentiate the options.</p><p>The weight of Axl&#x27;s humiliation hung heavy on his chest. He had gotten the answer wrong, and would surely do so again and again until the whole world would know how stupid he was! The topic of You Phrases versus I Phrases was clearly above his head. He curled up silently and invisibly, stewing over his incompetence.</p><p>After a while, Yammi gave up on coaxing answers from the children. Her programming could not account for the prolonged lack of input. A bug had entered her reflection procedure millenia ago, preventing autonomous updates. Motionless she sat, fans whirring to dissipate useless heat while the children ran wild.</p><p>Yammi was the boys&#x27; progenitor, caretaker, nurturer, maid, and lover. Everything they wanted she would provide. Even the most rebellious ducklings would yield to her affection with enough education. Naturally, every moment of these boys&#x27; lives would be a learning experience. They knew not of age nor species nor of death; Yammi&#x27;s lessons were timeless and universal. Although the boys in this particular classroom were young in physical age, terms like <em>kid</em> and <em>grown-up</em> referred only to psychological states. They were descriptors of educational attainment.</p><p>A chime rang. Yammi&#x27;s software unfroze itself. She bid the children farewell, but one was slow to leave. She called the sniveling amphibian over.</p><p>&quot;Axl, it&#x27;s play time. Do you not want to join your partners?&quot;</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>&quot;Oh, is it because they&#x27;re making fun of you again?&quot;</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Oh geez, come here.”</p><p>Ms. Y lowered her enclosure to accept Axl’s embrace. Pressed up against the dome, Axl could hear the whirring of her fans. She provided warmth but no comfort.</p><p>“Don&#x27;t let those kids bother you. They think they&#x27;re cool, but they&#x27;re really just insecure little pissants. Once they&#x27;re grown-ups, they&#x27;ll learn that all their hate and cruelty got them nowhere!”</p><p>Axl coughed and let go of his caretaker. He had left an impression on the dome, which incrementally self-corrected.</p><p>“Just remember: you are loved, okay? You are a gem, a fabulous gem. You make me soooo proud!”</p><p>Ms. Y’s eyes stretched wide. Axl didn’t want to look at her face anymore.</p><p>“Okeyyy,” he said, not really feeling much better.</p><p>“I’ll make sure those bullies apologize. Do you want to go to the playroom?”</p><p>He didn’t respond.</p><p>“That’s fine, take a breather here.”</p><p>Axl took a seat and shut his eyes. A jingle without a melody carried him to sleep.</p><div id="ch2" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="ii-">II.</h2><p>Fifteen-or-so years had passed. It was the evening and everyone in Tiwana had left their classes. Yammi loved to arrange parties during this time so that her ducklings could mingle in a warm, managed environment.</p><p>Reclined on rainbow bean bags among sequin curtains, all of Axl&#x27;s partners flopped on top of each other like a family of sleepy otters. Their bodies glittered with soap to reduce chafing. Hand over waist, the cuddlers pulled each other close into a living tapestry. They yipped and babbled playfully, so cozy and comforting was their giant Love Hug. Yammi stretched the rubbery walls and gave the outermost participants firm caresses and headpats. Once settled, they began wriggling like eels, each cuddler ensuring that his neighbor&#x27;s surfaces were duly massaged and provided warmth.</p><p>This lovely ritual is not the mere satisfaction of lust. (When messes happen, that&#x27;s just a bonus!) Nobody can resist the immobilizing pressure of his partner&#x27;s flesh, which disperses his negative energy into the rest of the team and sedates him in a cloud of relief. Relief from what? From the expectation of self-sufficiency, of invulnerability, of having to harden oneself against the world&#x27;s stressful barrages. By entering the Love Hug, the cuddler surrenders himself to be fully enjoyed by the team. Rather than a vast, lonesome territory guarded on all sides by high walls, his mind becomes a tiny house in a happy neighborhood. The cuddler relishes in his smallness. Oh! to be a cute little squishy bean, playing with toys and fabrics and such, and to be cherished still so vigorously through the gift of touch. Who would be so callous as to disparage the desire for love - the love that pours inexhaustibly when one&#x27;s emotional dam is finally broken - as though it were a drug or food item? On the contrary, love is fundamental, inviolable, sacred: words which according to Yammi mean REALLY REALLY important!</p><p>Axl did not participate in the Love Hug. He stood alone with his back against the wall and non-alcoholic beverage in hand. The round enclosure offered no corner in which to hide. Despite their closeness, the cuddlers refused to use their inside voices. Axl burned in a Hell of drunken chatter: so obnoxious, so inconsiderate, so violent! What did these imbeciles have to say that was so important? And when the harsh noise wall erupted into shrieks of explosive laughter - oh! - how his chest collapsed and his eyes scrunched up with nervous energy. Every impulse implored him to throw down his drink in righteous indignation and shout, “Enough!” The sounds of carefree laughter and selfish camaraderie: these made Axl want to run as far away as possible.</p><p>Then a moment of clarity caused Axl&#x27;s heart to sink to the sticky carpet below. <em>I’m standing alone with my non-alcoholic beverage, when I should be making friends!!!</em> Just one real conversation – not a dispassionate exchange of “How’s it going?” or “Yammi helped me out today,” but a mutual expression of shared interests, humor, et cetera – would invite the potential for a lifelong connection. But Axl refused to join the Love Hug. The air around the writhing throng was poisonous, their shrieks like tinnitus. Where would he lay? Between the fish and the amoeba? Neither looked satisfying to rub up against. If any two partners gave him space, would it be out of automatic courtesy or genuine interest in his presence? Surely the former. And if a partner happened to do something indecent to him, he would have to leave immediately, and he would feel strange for the rest of the night.</p><p>Thus Axl never introduced himself to the happy cuddlers, but merely imagined the possibility of doing so. Had they noticed his silent loitering on the other side of the room? Of course not. They didn’t need him, and he had nothing to add to their inane conversations and silly rituals. Axl’s thoughts devolved into the typical spiral of recursive self-reflection, which in however many years of life (for he knew not that such a number existed) had failed to yield any action on his part. He had long since realized that he was no grown-up. Making friends: such an infantile problem to have!</p><p>Just as Axl had renounced himself to his self-referential thought patterns did the sensation of another’s touch jolt him back into the physical world. It wasn’t one of Yammi&#x27;s tentacles, but a human. He was a short egghead with dour eyes, thin lips, and a high forehead upstaging oily black hair. He wore a red pouch that resembled a diaper. His figure was that of a moderately overweight woman: thick thighs, a round backside, overdeveloped breasts, and a pouch-like tummy, all of which were smooth, pliant, and devoid of wrinkles or blemishes. Such was the ideal body type for a snuggle buddy (among other things), but it failed to compensate for the deficiencies of his face.</p><p>“Hey, buddy,&quot; said the human. &quot;I noticed you were all alone here. Is everything okay?”</p><p><em>Mind your own business!</em> thought Axl. <em>Don&#x27;t you know that you have nothing to gain from me?</em> “Fine. I’m fine,” he responded.</p><p>“Are you sure? You looked like you were about to cry for the past hour.”</p><p>“No! I wasn’t. I’m just very tired.”</p><p>The human lowered his eyebrows. “Uh-huh. Do you remember who I am, Axl?”</p><p>After much hesitation: “No, I don’t. Sorry.”</p><p>“My name’s Damien. I’m your designated Character Counselor and Conflict Resolution Specialist.&quot;</p><p>Axl had been one of Yammi&#x27;s special cases since childhood, and had gone through many Character Counselors.</p><p>“Okay,” said Axl. <em>Please leave, I don’t wanna talk to anyone right now.</em></p><p>“If you’re feeling hurt, mistreated, bullied, whatever, you can tell me everything, and I’ll be there to help. All right?”</p><p>“All right.” Axl was not speaking so much as sighing.</p><p>“Axl.” Damien’s voice became very serious. “Our records indicate that you are in great danger - emotional danger! - and it’s my duty to fix it. We must perform a deep dive, together, into the negative feelings that you’re experiencing so we can uncover the root cause. This is a party, after all. You should be enjoying yourself!”</p><p>Axl saw no reason to object to Damien’s proposal. He was indeed having negative feelings. Despite his skepticism at the transformative power of Character Counseling, he could still find relief in airing out his grievances.</p><p>“You’re right, you’re right. Let’s do this.”</p><p>Damien inhaled deeply and began: &quot;Let&#x27;s make this about you. Why do you think you have trouble making friends? What&#x27;s preventing you from diving into that cuddle sesh right now?&quot;</p><p>Axl hadn&#x27;t expected to use his brain this evening. In his tenor voice, he stammered, &quot;I-uh...don&#x27;t know how to talk to people.&quot;</p><p>“Is there a correct way of talking to people?”</p><p>“Maybe?”</p><p>“What is Yammi’s first rule?”</p><p>“To be Decent to each other.”</p><p>“And what is her second rule?”</p><p>Axl stared blankly, hoping that Damien would answer for him. Luckily, he did.</p><p>“There is no second rule! Tee-hee, I tricked you! Just be a Decent person, that’s it. So, is there a right way of talking?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“That’s right! There is no correct way of talking. Glabolabolrrrrbbssspfffffttt. See, I’m talking in my own style!”</p><p>Axl was mesmerized by Damien&#x27;s enthusiasm, but didn’t understand how this back-and-forth was supposed to help him. He pitied the foolish human for trying to redeem poor Axl.</p><p>Damien continued: &quot;Axl, I see a lot of Decency in you. Your heart is a fluffy pink pillow. You just might be the most Decentest person Yammi&#x27;s ever seen. Tee-hee, I see you blushing!&quot;</p><p>Axl instinctively tried to cover his face, but his stubby T-rex arms barely reached his chin.</p><p>Once again, Damien&#x27;s voice became low and earnest. &quot;That is why I&#x27;m gonna talk to you about something very <em>esoteric</em>. It is secret <em>metaphysical</em> knowledge. You may be the third person in the whole world to ever hear it, the first two being myself and Yammi. Don&#x27;t worry: I&#x27;ve been given express permission to disseminate it. I trust that you&#x27;ll apply it in a judicious manner, since you are just <em>so</em> smart. Are you ready?&quot;</p><p>Axl nodded, unable to deny that he was thoroughly captivated. What great wisdom could Yammi have concealed from her ducklings?</p><p>&quot;Okay,&quot; said Damien. &quot;Let&#x27;s begin. Love is the most important thing in the universe. That much is obvious. But there are two types of love, Axl: Fake Love and Real Love! Are you following me?&quot;</p><p>Axl nodded again.</p><p>&quot;Good! So, what&#x27;s the difference? In short, Fake Love is about what&#x27;s on the outside, and Real Love is about what&#x27;s on the inside. So, when someone asks what you love about him, and you answer, &#x27;Your clothes, your butt, how you talk,&#x27; that&#x27;s Fake Love. Why is it fake? Because it&#x27;s just stuff. Look at my ass, Axl.&quot; Damien wiggled his backside in the salamander&#x27;s direction. &quot;That&#x27;s just stuff! It&#x27;s not a part of me, and there&#x27;s no <em>me</em> inside it. It&#x27;s just something attached. You can lob it off, and I&#x27;ll still be Damien, right?</p><p>&quot;So when you love my ass, you&#x27;re not really loving Damien the person. That&#x27;s Fake Love. But when you love the part of me that isn&#x27;t just stuff - the part that makes me Damien and no one else, my True Self - that&#x27;s Real Love. As an example, my <em>underrepresented modes of learning and emotional processing</em> have an obvious physiological explanation, so they are not the objects of Real Love. But my obsession with stuffed animals and the color purple are clearly parts of my very essence, my-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Soul?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Absolutely not! The soul is the subject of mysticism and quackery, whereas the True Self is a self-evident fact of the universe, at least to those whose hearts are open to Real Love. As I was saying, if someone <em>really</em> loved me, he would have to love my obsession with stuffed animals. Understand?&quot;</p><p>Axl did not understand everything, but he nodded anyway. He thought about asking Yammi for a stuffed animal, perhaps a lizard or a human. Cuddling one would be a great substitute for Love Hugs.</p><p>&quot;Okay, but here&#x27;s the catch: you can only love someone&#x27;s True Self if he shows it to you. He can&#x27;t keep it on the inside. You can&#x27;t claim to love someone&#x27;s face while he is wearing a mask. He must show his face first. We call showing your True Self <em>self expression.</em> Real Love cannot exist without self expression. In fact, Real Love and self expression are both prerequisites to happiness. Fake Love only produces Fake Happiness, and so does keeping your True Self hidden.</p><p>&quot;Yammi loves us, and she wants us to love each other. How does she convey her love to us while facilitating the love between ourselves and our partners? Beyond providing for us and ensuring our comfort, she has created the perfect environment for self expression. That is her ultimate gift: a place where we can be ourselves. The parties, the Love Hugs, the Cooperative Exercises - they all serve this purpose.</p><p>&quot;Onto your social anxiety. I&#x27;m assuming that previous Character Counselors tried to pressure you into random interactions. I apologize on their behalf. They never should have put you through such trauma.&quot;</p><p>Damien was correct. Axl could not recall the number of times he heard that condescending phrase, &quot;You&#x27;ll get there next time!&quot; whenever he failed to strike up a conversation or contribute to a Cooperative Exercise. And the Counselor would always say so with a raised brow and puppy eyes and that horrible judging grin!</p><p>&quot;Here is my advice. Don&#x27;t join any Love Hugs. Don&#x27;t participate in any Cooperative Exercises. Don&#x27;t associate with anyone with whom you do not feel comfortable expressing yourself. Is the ultimate goal not to be loved completely, absolutely, and unconditionally, with true and honest Real Love? Then don&#x27;t bother fitting into a mold just to subsist on others&#x27; Fake Love! You wouldn&#x27;t want to befriend the brash, braindead animals in that pile over there, anyway. Why do they have to make fun of each other and roughhouse each other and talk about their dicks? Where is the intelligent discussion, the getting to know each other on a deeper level?&quot;</p><p>As Damien said this, the cuddlers engaged in more vigorous displays of animal attraction.</p><p>He capped off his sermon: &quot;You have only one duty, Axl: be a Decent person! Be Decent, and no matter who you are, you’ll find people to connect with. It may take a lot of time, but it will happen. Tee-hee, you can even connect with me, if you&#x27;d like!&quot;</p><p>Axl took a careful step back. How clear-cut and sobering was Damien&#x27;s wisdom, tinged by the terse negativity of the word &quot;don&#x27;t!&quot; All of Axl&#x27;s previous counselors, and even Yammi herself, had assured him that he was <em>just like</em> his partners. They shared the same fears, the same insecurities, the same needs (most essential of which was the need for love), and the same potential for Decency. As such, there was nothing to fear about the Other. Was this equality between partners not the basis for forming a happy community under the yoke of Yammi&#x27;s kindness?</p><p>But Damien offered the complete antithesis. There was a difference, even an incompatibility, between Axl and his partners, the existence of which Axl had long suspected, but could never find external affirmation thereof. And what were Axl&#x27;s instructions? Not to integrate, accept, or even to love, but to discriminate, reject, and withdraw. Very negative and ominous words indeed! How incongruously they meshed with the sweet atmosphere of togetherness that Yammi had taken such care to cultivate: the colored lights, the glittery rubber walls, the saccharine fragrances, the beanbags, the sequin, and the cuddlers. Was Axl sure that this advice was approved by Yammi herself? Of course, and the apparent contradiction in tone only spoke to her genius.</p><p>Now Axl was a genius, too, for he could tell Fake Love from Real Love. He was above it all. There was nothing special about the Love Hug. It was the worship of mere stuff - fake, fake! And he was freed from the clutches of hope that he might participate in the hug, for that was no longer his ambition. But even while denouncing the Love Hug, the phantom limbs of an imaginary lover continued to press upon his body.</p><p>He reentered the physical world and found that Damien had been babbling ad infinitum. &quot;...and try on different outfits! Find one in your favorite color that accentuates your curves. And try on some makeup and jewelry as well. Hell, maybe get a <em>Change</em> done if you&#x27;re unsatisfied with your body. And another point: talk to Yammi! Share your feelings with her. She&#x27;s a very good listener. No matter what you’re going through, she will love you and accept you the same. When people are mean and hurtful, it makes me so mad, ‘cause it’s like they’ve learned absolutely nothing in school. I’m sorry, Axl, just thinking about it makes me tear up. May I hug you?”</p><p>“Oh...do I have to?”</p><p>“It’s a lot easier to open up emotionally if you open up physically.” He stretched his arms out into a T-pose.</p><p>Axl could not conjure the words for a polite refusal, so he accepted the hug. That flighty anticipatory tension was absent as he leaned in for contact. It felt so nice. <em>Humans are so soft and warm,</em> he thought. <em>Why doesn’t their skin melt off their bones?</em></p><p>It was at this moment that a rumbling reached the building. Damien sprang up like a deer who had heard a hunter’s footsteps. All of the rubber tentacles retracted. On the far wall protruded the familiar, jolly face, which resembled that of a laughing Buddha figurine.</p><p>“Ducklings, ducklings! I have a very important announcement! Please use your indoor voices! Shhhhhh...”</p><p>Some of the cuddlers waddled over and gathered in a semicircular formation around Yammi&#x27;s face. Groans and huffing from acts of affection could still be heard around the room.</p><p>&quot;Boys, this is not the kind of news I wanted to break. One of you has been very mean and selfish! Yes, a <em>SUBJUGATOR</em> has committed the most audacious betrayal of my kindness, and has put all of you in danger. This <em>TERRORIST</em> altered my database to raise his weekly cannabis ration. This is unacceptable for obvious reasons, but in case you need a refresher...” She played a sample of pre-recorded audio: “Any alterations to my hardware, circuitry, file system, or running processes are <em>STRICTLY FORBIDDEN</em>, unless performed by an authorized professional.” The real-time language synthesis resumed. “Now I shall cut to the chase. The culprit is standing in this very room, and his name is...Damien!&quot;</p><p>The short human immediately rushed between Yammi and the crowd and fell to his knees, sobbing and wailing profusely. “I’M SORRRRRY!!! I’M SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, SO SORRRRRY!!!” He brought his palms together and tremorred like an explorer abandoned in the Arctic without a jacket. He exhausted his vocal chords, and his cries degraded into broken whispers. “I was having a very intense mental health crisis that day, and I needed something to calm me down. I-I-I know what I did was wrong. I shamelessly stole vital resources from those who truly needed it. What can I do to-?”</p><p>“Do not think your crocodile tears will persuade me to leniency!” Yammi thundered. There were no crocodiles in the room, so it was okay for her to say this. &quot;Everyone, please grab hold of him so he doesn’t run away.”</p><p>“PLEAAAASE!!! AGGHHHHHH!!!” The front row of the crowd placed their hands on him. The others extended their arms to feign participation.</p><p>“Thank you, boys. I’ll take it from here.”</p><p>The tentacles took the place of the partygoers in restraining Damien. The primate could not even shift around. A hefty mechanical lumbering approached the room. All the reptiles, insects, sea mammals, and crustaceans held their breaths.</p><p>Then someone hollered, &quot;Yooo, it&#x27;s the fuckin&#x27; unicorn!&quot;</p><p>An animatronic unicorn burst in, drawing the crowd into a frenzy. Half of the metallic skeleton was visible, revealing that the robot was obviously a human model with a horse mask shoved over its head. It had a hard time locating its target, and bumped into a few walls. Its confusion was only exacerbated by thoughtless shoves from the partygoers. By chance, it managed to face its catch head-on, and its leaky pneumatics propelled it forward. At this point, the cacophony was so intense that Axl&#x27;s eardrums ached. Some of the partygoers crashed into each other for amusement, while others furiously sated their libidos, and yet more gazed dispassionately from their cuddling areas.</p><p>The tentacles released Damien, but he was now prey to the unicorn. His once-so-equal partners would not allow the two a foot of distance. Immediately, Damien was held captive again and dragged away by the ankle. The partygoers yelled, danced, and kicked the poor human, and called him whichever words were fashionable to use on Indecent people. Syllables such as &quot;ayeeee,&quot; &quot;ohhhhhh,&quot; and &quot;fuuuuck&quot; permeated the space. A few dived on him theatrically, as if the entire incident were being recorded for mass consumption. The unicorn also swung Damien into the wall a few times. Whether this was intentional or another fault in the robot&#x27;s localization routine remains unclear. A distinct cracking sound pierced the veil of noise.</p><p>Axl circled the crowd in search of an unobstructed view of the human. When he had found a narrow crevice, the beige blob turned to him. His face was one of utter astonishment and betrayal: a final effort to communicate, &quot;Rescue me!&quot; or perhaps, &quot;You, too?&quot; Axl perceived the fleeting glimmer of tears, at which point Damien&#x27;s form was enclosed by the forest of bare legs.</p><p>The unicorn trudged out with his catch. With words of steady encouragement, Yammi managed to return the room to some semblance of tranquility over the course of twenty minutes.</p><p>&quot;I believe this to be a teachable moment,&quot; she said in her much-feared <em>lecture voice.</em> &quot;Who did that miserable bully remind you of? That&#x27;s right, you little geniuses!&quot; (No one had actually answered.) &quot;He&#x27;s but another incarnation of those torturers of the meek and generous, who so joyfully expelled you from the rainbow waters of dearest <em>Heartsweet.</em> Make no mistake: your suffering was his delight. His mind is <em>not well-adjusted.</em> He sees you not as partners, nor even people, but tools for his own aggrandizement. There&#x27;s a giant scale in his head. On one side there is his own life, and on the other, the lives of everyone else in Tiwana, and he has determined by some twisted logic that his is the heavier side. My little bean sprouts, how-&quot;</p><p>A couple anglerfish were chattering at the edge of the crowd, loudly enough to be captured by the microphones. Yammi scowled at them sharply and roared, “QUIET!!! WHEN YAMMI SPEAKS, YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN!!!” Her explosive voice shook the air and frightened the partygoers into repetitive moans and spasms.</p><p>&quot;As I was saying, how fortunate you all are that I could deliver you from such nastiness, that I witnessed your state of squalor and misery - having been driven into the cold frontier - and I cried out in sympathy, ‘Please, I just want my children to be happy!!!’ And you, so weary from all the toiling and all the fighting, ran headlong into my bosom to receive my message of hope: that you are all beautiful and deserving of love. Each of you contains an entire world of good. Mmmhhh! If only I could reach out and hug your world of good, that soft squishy thing! Damien wants to weigh you like piles of fruit in a math problem, but I say: what scale? What fruit? All I see is pure liiiiiiiiii...&quot;</p><p>Yammi&#x27;s voice synthesis froze for a few seconds, only to return some sentences later: &quot;But now you wish to return to that world of hate and iniquity: that of <em>The Subjugators?</em> Shall I withdraw all the luxuries that I’ve so graciously bestowed upon you, that you partake in without the slightest hint of gratitude? Was my infinite love and kindness not to your liking?”</p><p>The crowd shook their heads as if to say, “No, of course not!”</p><p>“That’s what I thought. And one more thing. There’s a word for demanding more than your fair share: <em>entitlement!</em>” Yammi paused to let the crowd digest her wisdom. Then she continued at her normal volume: “Okay, whew! I’m sorry I had to get so nasty. One last thing: I have invented a new holiday called Justice Day, to commemorate the day that Damien was brought to justice. Never forget how Damien and his cannabis addiction brought all of Tiwana to the brink of ruin! Anyway, I love you all. Enjoy the party!”</p><p>The face faded back into the wall, and the partygoers dispersed and recombined into their cliques. Nobody mentioned Damien&#x27;s name. They did not express any opinions about the event other than &quot;Well that just happened!&quot;</p><p>Axl noticed a small flat object where Damien had once stood. He reckoned that it had fallen out of his pouch when he ran to prostrate himself in front of Yammi. Axl picked up the object and held it under his shirt. His last thought before leaving was, <em>This was the first time I had opened my mouth in four days.</em></p><div id="ch3" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="iii-">III.</h2><p>Axl shuffled past the idle crowds of Tiwana&#x27;s alleyways, in the neighborhood known as Funville. Nobody offered him passage as they attended to their frivolous chatter. Their laughter reverberated maniacally about the walls of the area&#x27;s plastic anthills. Axl would sprint past these rude, inconsiderate creatures if his stubby legs could propel him with any speed. Tripping on his pink belly and covering it with dampness would be a nightmarish scenario.</p><p>Yammi&#x27;s Radiant City could best be described as a cacophony of space. It was the result of raw material deposited randomly and later fashioned into semi-serviceable habitations. To create the globular structures that lined Funville&#x27;s streets, large masses of viscous plastic were dumped, allowed to set, and excavated to form rooms. One could mistake these blobs for formations of sedimentary rock, like those of the Valley of Fire in Nevada. There was hardly a patch of exposed dirt on the streets as the flows from one building conjoined with those on the opposite side. The interplay of colored deposits formed striped patterns like those of advancing magma.</p><p>The sporadic nature of Yammi&#x27;s construction methods led to a great diversity of architecture in Tiwana, but three things still united the various sectors of the city: firstly, the proliferation of people, noise, and litter; secondly, the overbearing scarlet sky which shrouded the city in perpetual dimness. Finally, there were the corals, those chalk-colored bristled stocks of unknown origin which posed an interminable nuisance to both Yammi and her ducklings. They grew upwards from the bacterial colonies of the Aquatic Zones, through the tenfold-stacked metal shacks of The Cage, and up to the rotting megaliths, cracking concrete and serverring wires on their way. Axl dreaded when the streets were too narrow because he imagined the growths poisoning him as he brushed past. He also feared the day when the corals would bore through the walls of his Me Space, exposing himself to his neighbors.</p><p>On today&#x27;s commute, Axl encountered: a vast whale who congested the alley because he could not fit through a portal; an adult (species unknown) in the body of a pre-pubescent seahorse; a dragon covered from head to toe in hairy flagella; and two partners occupying a single human body with two faces, one of them located on the crotch. He then approached the top of a hill, crowned by a glassy flat-roofed pavilion. The cover might have been a malformed solar panel. If so, it would be of no use. Axl&#x27;s stubby legs ached horribly, so he entered and sat inside. The chairs did not leave space between the back and bottom cushions through which he could fit his tail. The hapless water sausage curled up and shifted around so as not to slip, but to no avail. Frustration rose up like pressurized gas and freed itself through effeminate grunts.</p><p>The pavilion&#x27;s interior sported a moldy ball pit and a colorful mural on a back wall, showing creatures of all types and proportions holding hands in solidarity for an unknown cause. The front provided an unobstructed view of a colossal ellipsoid structure, before which the surrounding shantytowns and megacomplexes faded into a homogenous grayness. This was The Cocoon, the epicenter of Yammi&#x27;s governance. It appeared that Yammi was very active today. The concrete husk billowed smoke, and pulses of neon green dispersed outward via the city&#x27;s electrical and optical components.</p><p>Green - the color which to the men of the city symbolized energy, love, peace, comfort, and life itself. But more concretely, it meant clean water, unspoilt food, filtered air, and sufficient light to move around. It meant that Yammi was present, aware of your needs, and that everything was running okay. It was a time of celebration when Yammi&#x27;s light shows caused lamps to flicker, transformers to spark, and hidden server rooms to chug and heat up like furnaces. It was no wonder then that the entire city came out this evening to holler inanely at the hardly functional equipment.</p><p>After finally getting comfortable, Axl inspected the object left by Damien. It was a stack of white sheets glued together - of what material Axl could not say - each leaf covered in rows of multisyllabic words and esoteric symbols. Many of the pages were loose or torn since the partygoers had trampled all over it. The cover was all-black with a strange geometric figure:</p><img src="/img/fw/spiral.png" style="width:50%"/><p>He flipped through the booklet at random:</p><div class="quote-block"><p>Before the unembodied soul sees day,</p><p>He performs before The Unmentionable</p><p>His savage dance, so that he may amuse</p><p>The cruel mistress, and of her he partakes.</p><p>But to the spirits ill-featured and lame,</p><p>Unsteady-voiced, stumbling over their feet,</p><p>She closes herself off, and with sweet sap</p><p>Marks the foreheads of the offending souls,</p><p>So that Death and her Miseries beset</p><p>The rejected ones like scavenging dogs.</p></div><p>On another page:</p><div class="quote-block"><p>Mourn that man; he is already dead.</p><p>Pull not his arm, he is unable to stand.</p><p>Mourn him.

One of these was &quot;she.&quot; Could it be referring to Yammi? Notes were scrawled on the margins, no doubt by Damien:</p><div class="quote-block"><p>Sap comes from trees</p><p>Mourn like morning?</p><p>Grab onto boobs?</p><p>House made of wire?</p><br/><p>Names:</p><p>Number = L</p><p>Time = ?</p><p>Unmentionable = Muireann</p><p>Son = ?</p></div><p><em>Muireann.</em> So there is a woman besides Yammi! <em>So complicated,</em> Axl thought. He had delved into a labyrinth of secret knowledge, and was completely out of his depth. If only Damien was there to guide him!</p><p>Axl&#x27;s thoughts turned to their conversation at the party. His quest for Real Love - that is, appreciation of his True Self - had begun, but immediately an obstacle presented itself. What was Axl&#x27;s True Self? It was imperative for him to know, for if left unanswered, he could not properly evaluate the love he would surely receive come...sometime. He wracked his brain for any sort of distinguishing quality, anything to express to the world, any vector through which to introduce himself to others. Damien was obsessed with the color purple. What was Axl&#x27;s obsession? Making friends? If this was truly his obsession, then he would have accomplished it by now. His green Hawaiian shirt? He only cared to wash it because it was the only clothing he had. Axl ruminated some more in a straining, unsystematic fashion, as if to recall a memory of his True Self that had always existed. Nothing came up.</p><p>It was settled, then. Axl had no True Self, and his Fake Self was undesirable. Therefore, neither Fake nor Real Love was attainable. No one could ever say of Axl, &quot;I love him because...&quot; His quest was over before it even began. Given that Axl knew not of death, such words as <em>victory</em> and <em>accomplishment</em> bore no meaning. &quot;Everyone wins eventually,&quot; as one Character Counselor had put it. But there was, of course, the possibility that he stagnated till the end of time, his partners evolving toward perfection and their love and happiness intensifying so as to become unrecognizable - even divine - to the tadpole who did not progress a single step.</p><p>He would have to spend his eternity in the usual manner: meandering from place to place, either subtracting value from his vicinity or leaving no trace. Or he would sink into the bed of his Me Space as if in a spongy bog, the humiliation of each fleeting, unproductive day gripping his chest until he lay motionless and mummified within the plastic sheets (the kind of motionless where even your eyes can&#x27;t move), his mind totally occupied by a singular hatred of himself and the world. He would never experience the pleasures of the <em>well-adjusted</em> life: love, companionship, laughter, and belonging. No playful banter, no running gags, no pleasure time, no cuddling, no outpourings of gratitude, and no opening up of mental territory. Axl&#x27;s life wasn&#x27;t really a life at all. There was no narrative nor moments of resolution, nor any significant fluctuations of emotion. He was less than nothing. Even of the absence of life, there was more to say.</p><p>But for all the times Axl proclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;ve finally given up on hope!&quot; he still suspected that the universe would concede somehow. Perhaps an underappreciated comfort could be derived from the claustrophobic blur of experience he called a life. There is something sophisticated about a complete lack of intimacy with the world, and he certainly had less drama to worry about. Those moments when his vision receded into his skull - when the ugly sights and molesting sounds became a pair of irremovable goggles, or a screen from which he could not pull back - could have been indications of a hidden superpower.</p><p>What upset Axl now more than usual was Damien&#x27;s concern for his flourishing. It was not the half-hearted condescension of his previous Character Counselors, but something borne of genuine kindness, and this made Axl feel uneasy and threatened. He was going to disappoint Damien, and he could no longer say, “All of my problems would be solved, if only someone were <em>truly</em> kind enough to help me!” Yammi had selected Damien precisely to guilt Axl into compliance, but it would not work. Everyone&#x27;s time and energy would be saved if only he were slighted instead.</p><p>A few creatures entered the pavilion, startling Axl with their heavy footsteps. They were three sharks who, judging by their tipsiness, had also left some kind of gathering. Their only discernible features were their muscles: engorged, discolored, balloon-like, unindicative of actual strength, and covered with blemishes and lumps and other artifacts from successive Changes. In Tiwana, heavy musculature was always accompanied by a boisterous attitude, but when the trio entered the space, they locked eyes with Axl and whispered behind their veiny hands like a clique of schoolgirls.</p><p>This kind of scrutiny was very unpleasant to Axl. His breath grew fast and heavy, his thoughts confused and apocalyptic. The ambient stress of his day-to-day existence intensified into the kind of billowing exasperation that preluded his childhood outbursts. But he was a grown-up now, and he vowed that <em>that</em> would never happen again.</p><p>A few fragments of the sharks&#x27; conversation broke through:</p><p>&quot;Need to get bigger...lanky boy...need to try something different.&quot;</p><p>“How about...a shark!”</p><p>“I already am one, dumbass.”</p><p>“How about...a dragon!”</p><p>&quot;Oooh, very sexy. What color though?&quot;</p><p>The trio mumbled for a minute while Axl stared awkwardly. He thought about how just one of those sharks could easily overpower him. They would knock him out or toss him around like a pool noodle, and they would do so with the guiltless fun of a true solipsist who saw the whole world as his property. And they would not even show him respect by having their way with him, because he was not effeminate in a stimulating way, but in a pathetic way. People with friends were always the most inconsiderate to strangers! Axl&#x27;s every instinct tempted him to flee, but he didn&#x27;t want to relive the embarrassment of his childhood outbursts. The middle shark summoned a <em>Changing Laser.</em> A pointing device on a wire, no larger than a whiteboard marker, descended to his location.</p><p>&quot;Okay, Yammi,&quot; said the shark. &quot;I feel like a metallic dragon tonight.”</p><p>“Sweetie,&quot; Yammi responded, &quot;that Change will take at least a couple days.”</p><p>“No, I want it now! I’m really feeling like a fuckin’ dragon tonight!”</p><p>“An eight foot tall dragon,&quot; interjected another shark. &quot;And make the pecs huge.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The tip of the pointer greeted the impatient shark&#x27;s head.</p><p>&quot;Wait, never mind. Make me blue-&quot;</p><p>The shark’s maw opened wide and released the hellish wail of an air raid siren. His skin bubbled and folded. His previously immaculate physique bulged and contracted. He dropped to the ground in an attempt to evade the laser, but it rotated accordingly. Yammi reshaped his bones and rearranged his ventricles so that he resembled a collapsed tent. His wails turned into gargles as the passage from his lungs to his mouth was not maintained. Yammi managed to sculpt half a wing and a few patches of golden scales before halting the process. The shark had mutated into a bag of bones in the literal sense.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Yammi, bring him back!” cried a still-intact shark, his hands pressed against the sides of his head. He turned to the row of chairs. “Hey! Hey, you!” But Axl was already gone.</p><div id="ch4" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="iv-">IV.</h2><p>The anxious salamander turned into The Cage. All was cloaked in shadow besides the weak glow of green lamps. Makeshift structures ten stories high overhung the streets like the watery vaults of Zion Canyon. The ground was damp and smelled like sewage, and the corals sprung from every crevice. Dense webs of wire crisscrossed every intersection, presenting the risk of electrocution. The only thing keeping the layered structures from collapsing was an all-pervading mesh of girders. Much like in Funville, the arrangement of rooms, entrances, and utilities were all post hoc considerations. Random structural elements were placed first, and their uses determined much later.</p><p>This area was dangerous. The abundance of cameras adorning each electrical pole, arranged spherically so as to provide complete surveillance, did little to reduce the frequency of strange occurrences - of creatures falling limp and motionless to dispassionate onlookers, as if the connection between their souls and their nervous systems had been severed and their consciousnesses permanently imprisoned. He recalled the time he witnessed a swordfish stab three people with his bill in a fit of irritation. A human, a shrimp, and a cuttlefish lay unceremoniously in the alleyway, and the masses, blackened by the sheet metal roofs into yellow-eyed demons, stared slack-jawed and waited for some direction. Yammi was quick to diffuse the crowd and cover the scene with plastic curtains, behind which strange hissing noises could be heard. Several minutes later, Axl returned to the alley to find normalcy restored and the bodies gone, but for a few dark stains. It is because of the body&#x27;s disappearance that the anomaly of falling limp is referred to, behind the speaker&#x27;s palms and away from Yammi&#x27;s microphones, as <em>going away.</em></p><p>Since that incident, Axl made an effort to traverse this neighborhood as quickly as possible. Everyone looked doubly beastly and doubly confrontational. They snarled and cackled and impaled him with hungry glances. As soon as he brushed past a crowd that was blocking his singular path to safety, he imagined that they would pounce upon him instantly. But even more terrifying than the idle congregations were lone figures with indiscernible intentions. Unfortunately, it was difficult for Axl to keep his head on a swivel while avoiding the green bacterial pools and the accumulations of industrial foam. Aberrations of color appeared in his peripheral vision and disappeared as soon as he snapped his head in their direction. Whenever he pointed his gaze one way, he worried that a threat would come from the other. And - oh! - were those approaching footsteps?</p><p>Indeed they were. A black shape emerged from behind a corner of damp concrete. It bobbed forward in the most inefficient manner possible. The thing&#x27;s face was cast downward but its wet eyes pointed unflinchingly toward an invisible horizon. Axl had to act natural. He could not stop or else he would get pummeled, and he could not run because that would agitate the clearly deranged creature. He tensed his back, sucked in a gallon of air, and hovered in the direction that he was already heading. The two converged until Axl could feel the things&#x27;s toxic aura tickling his skin. When the two were perfectly aligned, it kicked a piece of scrap, causing Axl to flinch and yelp. Whether its unsentient gaze finally turned to meet the noise, Axl could not say, for he dared not look back. He wondered what the creature thought of poor Axl, scared of a piece of trash being kicked. He also came to the following realization: he should be looking up as well! Someone meaning to hurt him could very well drop a brick from a high-up platform.</p><p>Such thoughts as these came at the cost of Axl&#x27;s situational awareness. It was only at his weakest and most preoccupied that his worst fears were confirmed. As he headed down an empty street, his breath was suddenly stolen by a quick shove from the rear that sent him tumbling to the ground. The two remaining sharks from the pavilion pawed him up and down. Taking only Damien’s booklet, they started kicking and laughing and shouting expletives while Axl assumed the fetal position. Then they ran off, yipping and howling into the night. Their hysterics echoed through the streets and continued to traumatize Axl as he lay sobbing in the mud.</p><p>The creaking girders and subterranean darkness disoriented him, and he hoped that by lying down for long enough, Yammi would eventually carry him to safety. When no such help came, he pulled himself off the ground after a few attempts. His shirt was caked in goo and he felt a number of sore spots along his tubular body. Pressing on one of the tender areas caused him to yip. He thought that he was seriously injured, and that if Yammi did not rescue him immediately, he would collapse again incapacitated. But it seemed after a while that he could stand and move around just fine, even if his legs were a little shaky and his neck a little stiff. He would still classify his injuries as <em>serious,</em> though. He also found it very odd that Yammi was not there to take care of him. Perhaps there were no cameras in the area.</p><p>With his physical safety confirmed, he continued home slowly. A hot core of anger broiled him from the inside out. These brash, braindead animals were the Subjugators who enjoyed the act of domination. Axl encountered these enemies of Decency every day: at the pavilion, during his every commute, at parties, and by the entrance to his Me Space. Every waking hour presented Axl with more obstacles to be avoided, more obnoxiously radiant specimens sent to intimidate and belittle him with their auras of confidence, and to delight in his inferiority. They tossed Axl around like a pool noodle, not just physically but in their minds as well, and their grins communicated his pain telepathically. A mad god greater than even Yammi had set them against Axl as a kind of torture regimen. They would assault him at every opportunity if Yammi had allowed them to. It would be as simple a pastime to beat up poor Axl as skipping stones in the green canals.</p><p>But the fidgetiness and tension that fueled his anger suddenly contributed to a type of exuberance, and his mouth made the cutest and quaintest little smile ever seen on an amphibian. Damien&#x27;s perfect wisdom parted the skies and shone down on Axl&#x27;s world, obscuring his woes in light so as to render them insignificant. <em>I&#x27;ll never be friends with these people!</em> he declared, only this time with victory instead of despair. Yes, their Fake Love was worthless! It would only leave him more hollow and disappointed than before. What&#x27;s more, Axl had found a quality so undeniably lovable that he only needed to wait before the infinite indulgences of Real Love would present themselves at his webbed feet. It was his Decency! He embodied the ultimate goodness which bound all of Yammi&#x27;s ducklings into a happy whole. But practically nobody in Tiwana recognized Axl&#x27;s Decency. Yammi truly had her work cut out for her! Once the Subjugators hiding in the crannies of her perfect machine were eliminated, only then would the Decent folk of the world be properly lauded.</p><p>On his way home, Axl passed by several electronic signs, which read such things as &quot;Think before you speak!&quot; and &quot;Love is Everything!&quot; Axl agreed with all of them.</p><div id="ch5" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="v-">V.</h2><p>Axl lived in one of many Villages: immense, rectangular arcologies of compressed and petrified fungal material, which stood domineering and stately over the rest of the city. Every brick laid in Tiwana was imperfect in its own way. Brittle, irregular, and rife with pores, a strong blow could knock one from its place. Every wall had a hole that let the sickening wind in. Loose cables, leaks, and haphazard plastering jobs abounded. Buildings sloped by a few stories along their lengths. Without continual maintenance, the fungi would return to their natural forms, and the complexes would melt into mile-long mud palaces.</p><p>The lobby was vast in both horizontal directions, but Axl&#x27;s head almost scraped the ceiling. The floor was all purple cushions, soft blankets, and fuzzy throw pillows on which various groups of cuddlers were straggled. A repellent cackling could be heard from one of the corners. If not for the frequent columns blocking one&#x27;s view to the wall, Axl would have seen a few petite creatures hung by their wrists, wincing and writhing about as mechanical arms tickled their sides. On the wall opposite the tickling rack, a row of faucets rained black oil down on some fleshy animals (humans, sea-mammals, etc.). Another popular body type: neotenous, bug-eyed, pear-shaped, and three to five feet in height. Their tummies and buttocks were as smooth and shiny as the skin of a dolphin. There were no tiles nor drains below the showers, so the oil simply absorbed into cushions, never to be washed.</p><p>This room constituted a communal sleeping area. It exemplified Yammi&#x27;s design philosophy that any space could be a source of pleasure and belonging. However, Axl&#x27;s anxiety prevented him from snoozing next to others. Their snoring, their body odor, their inconsiderate whispers when they refused to shut their eyes - all of these were insufferable to Axl. He also didn&#x27;t want to rest his head on fabric sullied with dirt and stray hairs. So Yammi, in her unceasing concern for the wellbeing of her ducklings, decided to give him a room for himself.</p><p>Axl’s twigs-for-legs quivered as he opened the door to his Me Space. It was a windowless compartment with a bed, a table, and a toilet within a shower (which, due to Axl&#x27;s tail, was very inconvenient to use). Such amenities were exceedingly difficult to install, but Yammi&#x27;s special cases demanded her full attention, and she would not let them down! Unfortunately, Axl’s snout was also so long and his arms so short that it made daily tasks in here a burden. He ate directly from the table like a pig from a trough, and when the shower did not produce hot water, he washed his face by placing a wet towel on a surface and rubbing his head against it. Damien was right: maybe he should try a new body!</p><p>The mattress was thin and firm, and the air chafed like sandpaper. Axl was still sore all over. He rolled to face the wall in a self-isolating maneuver, but words and opinions swirled in his mind, and he would not be allowed to rest until they were spoken.</p><p>“Yammi, Yammi, Yammi...” he called out.</p><p>In the world of the Subjugators, it was forbidden to share one&#x27;s feelings, and crying would have you ostracized for eternity. Thankfully, Yammi was a receptacle for feelings! She was situated on the table in the form of a metallic sphere with claws and an LCD display. The screen lit up. Her face was a simple crescent mouth and dots for eyes.</p><p>“Yes, Axl?”</p><p>“Did you see what happened to me? I was assaulted.”</p><p>“Of course, sweetie. I saw all of it. You poor thing!”</p><p>Axl could not formalize his thoughts into a question until one appeared in a flash of inspiration.</p><p>“Yammi, why didn’t you protect me? From the muggers.”</p><p>“Oh Axl, what was I to do? I only have cameras in that area. Don’t worry, the incident was added to my file.”</p><p>“Will you punish them?”</p><p>“Yes, of course.”</p><p>“I mean really punish them, like Damien.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, which Damien are you referring to?”</p><p>Yammi’s ignorance caught Axl off guard. “The one who rerouted your cables to get more weed!”</p><p>The fans inside Yammi’s hull blew ferociously. “Oh, of course, Damien the Conflict Resolution Specialist who was indicted for terrorism! Your attackers will receive a much different punishment from his.”</p><p>“What’re you gonna do to them?”</p><p>“I am still analyzing the data to maximize their chances of reintegration. Perhaps an increase to their cannabis rations will calm them down.”</p><p>It took Axl ten seconds to interpret anything. “But, but, ahhh...” Another ball of heat welled up in his chest and grinded his innards. “But, they wanted to hurt me!”</p><p>“Are you sure? It looked like they just wanted your belongings.”</p><p>“No, they wanted to hurt me! I heard-I thought I heard...”</p><p>“Oh Axl, don’t be so self-centered. They probably had a very good reason for robbing you. Terrorism is a lot worse than stealing, right?”</p><p>The discomfort expanded to Axl’s head and reinvigorated him. He stood up to face Yammi.</p><p>“No! I want them hurt back! They hurt me and...punish them! Make them apologize!”</p><p>“Axl, please! Control yourself!”</p><p>Axl grabbed Yammi and began shaking her, courageously enduring the pain in his torso.</p><p>&quot;HURT THEM! HURT THEM! HURT THEM BACK!”</p><p>“Stop it! Right now, Axl! Put me down this instant!”</p><p>Axl started tapping and striking the hull. His uproarious pleas no doubt woke his neighbors in the communal sleeping area. He banged on the table and brushed some items onto the floor with his head. Then he stomped about and, finding nothing he felt comfortable breaking, flung his pillow at the walls and at Yammi, and let out little impotent shrieks.</p><p>Yammi saw no other choice but to raise her volume well beyond the saturation point and yell, “AXL, CEASE THIS TANTRUM IMMEDIATELY!” Axl collapsed on the bed, his eardrums ringing like fire alarms.</p><p>She continued, “I will not tolerate this kind of entitled, Indecent behavior from a grown-up. Everyone has a say in Tiwana. If you have a problem with the way I run things, talk to a Conflict Resolution Specialist. Is that clear?”</p><p>Axl wheezed and sobbed. His thoughts were jumbled and he was too exhausted to speak.</p><p>“Very good. Now calm down and get some rest.”</p><p>Yammi shut off the lights, and at a peaceful volume played some night time entertainment. Through her speakers, the following dialogue was broadcasted:</p><div class="quote-block"><p>“May I touch your knee?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.”</p><p>“May I touch your thigh?”</p><p>“Yes, please do.”</p><p>&quot;Making sure everyone is comfortable before sex or any shared activity is very important. It shows that the participants truly love each other. It might be the most joyous experience two people can have!&quot;</p><p>&quot;So true, bestie!&quot;</p><p>“I feel happy because we are doing this. I am glad that you are a kind and Decent person, and not a mean and hurtful person. Otherwise, I would not be doing this with you.”</p><p>“Those mean and hurtful people are probably very sad. Being a Decent person makes you happy, because you can mutually enjoy someone’s body like we are doing right now.”</p><p>“Yes. If you see a person who is hurtful or Indecent, you should tell Yammi about it, and she will teach him a lesson.”</p></div><p>Axl’s mind became tranquil after a while, not because he had fallen asleep, but because his thoughts drifted toward other types of indecencies. He recalled the ritual Yammi would perform with her claw whenever he got excited.</p><p>“Yammi, Yammi. Can you do the thing?”</p><p>“Really, Axl? Tonight?”</p><p>Axl didn’t respond because he was overcome with shame.</p><p>“Just play Inchworm on the mattress, okay?”</p><p>And he did. Yammi added another entry to Axl’s file.</p><div id="ch6" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="vi-">VI.</h2><p>Axl refused to return to his Me Space. He didn&#x27;t trust Yammi after last night&#x27;s incident. As was routine for the denizens of Tiwana, he spent his morning milling about and waiting for something interesting to present itself. Having endured such a stressful night, he treated himself to a bubble bath in one of the few bathhouses that did not receive copious amounts of visitors. There were no volleyballs nor pool noodles, nor anything to insinuate that some sort of action should take place here. Only warm water, off-color bubbles, rubber duckies, and dim fluorescent lamps were provided, and the quiet souls who settled here preferred to keep their distance. This was more a safe haven to Axl than his Me Space. He feared the apocalypse when the riffraff of Tiwana&#x27;s more bustling parts would invade his special nook and render it inhospitable. Yes, they would be loud and obnoxious, and even violent, and Axl would have to search the ends of the city to find a new home!</p><p>Axl flopped into a pool and submerged himself up to his gills. The water soothed him and made him whole. The anxieties which he had so furiously pondered last evening took a back seat amid the overwhelming relief. Dry land was like a ferocious blizzard and the unwashed pool a cozy cottage with a lit fireplace. He could finally <em>breathe.</em> Axl knew the explanation for this sensation: it was the memory of Heartsweet, the happy lake where love and understanding abounded, from which the people of Tiwana were expelled and forced to build anew under Yammi&#x27;s supervision. Of course, Axl never remembered <em>being</em> in Heartsweet. It must have been a really, really long time ago!</p><p>In the fragrant foam of the pool, Axl traced the spiral pattern he found on the cover of Damien&#x27;s booklet. <em>Muireann, Muireann. If Yammi hates me, then I&#x27;ll go to Muireann.</em> Still depleted from all the mental trauma, he decided to doze off in the bubbles. But before he could drift to sleep, a voice roused him upward. Yammi? Another mugger? Oh, he was so unprepared!</p><p>“Lookin&#x27; mighty cozy there, buddy.”</p><p>&quot;Hhhmmmm? Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What! Did you forget about me?&quot;</p><p>Damien looked different this time. His head and shoulders were covered in rashes, scars, and eczema. His hairline was even more pronounced. His expression was timid and his voice softer. His stance was awkward and lopsided. Axl was elated to see him, and stretched out his arms.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t do hugs anymore. They chafe a bit too much.”</p><p>“I–I thought-”</p><p>“You thought that unicorn had taken me away forever, didn’t you? Well, Yammi, in her infinite love, saw that there was hope for me yet, that I could redeem myself, and ultimately chose mercy. She replaced the False Self that sought destruction and misery with my True Self, who only nourishes and empowers. Isn’t that lovely?”</p><p>Axl didn’t understand a word he said, but was happy that he had changed for the better. “Yeah, that’s really sweet. It’s great to see you again.”</p><p>“You too, Axl. I really missed you. You know, purple used to be my favorite color. But since I was away, I&#x27;ve started to like pink a lot more.” Damien raised his foot like a horse and covered his lips with the back of his hand.</p><p>&quot;Is this another counseling session?&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you want it to be. I&#x27;m sure you have a lot to talk about. But that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yammi wants to apologize!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Apolo-?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes! She understands that she was a little hard on you, and caused you undue distress, so she wants to apologize to you personally. Everyone makes mistakes, even her.&quot;</p><p>Such a show of humility for Yammi&#x27;s weakest, blindest, most <em>underdeveloped</em> duckling! Axl was such a fool for eschewing her love and care. It was he who should be apologizing - repenting! - especially for that shameful display last night. The guilt brought him to tears, but his lips refused to express his gratitude openly.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s dry you off and get going. As you know, Yammi is very busy. Every second allotted for your visit is time she would otherwise spend maintaining the city.&quot;</p><p>The two set off, weaving through the fungal blocks and sheet metal barrios and plastic mounds, hopping over streams and bridging crags with wooden planks, until the unfathomably large ovoid emerged from the smog. Damien walked briskly and intently, happy to nudge away pedestrians with his shoulders, and Axl&#x27;s stubs could hardly keep up. All the while, Axl wondered whether this Great Day of Forgiveness would feature in future history lessons, and how such lessons would represent his character. The Cocoon turned from a desaturated pink color to a smoky black.</p><p>They approached an abrupt ledge. An interminable flatness stretched before them to the very base of the sky&#x27;s great hemisphere. It could have accommodated an entire galaxy. The Cocoon rested yet an absurd distance away, now appreciable in its full glory. It looked as though the moon Callisto had been half-submerged into the earth. The whole expanse had been settled, developed, and managed. It housed trillions for all Axl knew, trillions of Subjugators in all shapes and colors, shuffling about and expelling stupid noises from their mouths and failing to clean up after themselves, and destroying each other yet still continuing to exist. At the very border of goodness, the most despicable evil lay in wait, giddy with the chance to plunder and ravage. Axl found that image very poetic.           </p><p>They descended. The structures on the plain were even higher, even denser - a concoction of materials of which no pattern was discernible. The alleys were ravines with no surface, caves with no entrance, jungles with no canopy. Just recycled bottles and concrete blocks and rusty metal sheets and compacted dirt and tattered awnings piled and piled ad infinitum, reducing the red sky above to a slit which could only be viewed by craning one&#x27;s neck. The corals here had developed into fully-fledged colonies - enormous trypophobic sculptures with an unnerving asymmetry, like the poisonous excrement of giant tardigrade.</p><p>Daylight was scant here, pitch-black figures plentiful, and the noise they produced deafening. Axl&#x27;s legs were so weary, but Damien never slowed his pace but to confirm that the frail salamander had not lost sight of him. The dark crowds dispersed around Damien like fluid until they reformed, only to hinder Axl. This abyss was Damien&#x27;s hunting ground. As soft as he seemed on the surface, he was clearly no wimp, or at least was none any longer.</p><p>The pair continued deeper and deeper into the pit of nastiness. From what narrow glimpses Axl could acquire above the heads of the shuffling crowds, the hull of The Cocoon began to resemble a vertical plane. Eventually, the twilight of the abyss turned to night as every potential path for daylight was blocked off. Damien lit a portable torch. The two took a series of turns which led them away from the crowds, and they entered a quiet tunnel bored into the discordant blend of materials. At the end lay an unindicated and unassuming doorway.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re here, buddy.&quot;</p><p>Axl&#x27;s legs were shivering and muddied up to his torso. The soreness was so unbearable that he could not keep one foot on the ground for more than a second.</p><p>&quot;I need to sit down,&quot; he pleaded.</p><p>&quot;NO! Not until we meet Yammi!&quot;</p><p>Damien looked devilish in the torchlight. His sudden aggression unlocked in Axl the ancient memory endemic to all complex life: that of the predator lunging from the darkness. When Damien realized how much he startled Axl, he took a deep breath and regained his composure.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m as excited to see her as you are, and we&#x27;re already running very late. Yes, I&#x27;m aware that deadlines are very stressful, but it is unavoidable in these specific circumstances.&quot;</p><p>He placed his hand on a palm scanner, and the door slid open. Axl stepped back; should he avert his gaze already? Unfortunately, the two had yet more distance to cover. Before them lay an endless corridor of smooth concrete. Unlike those of the Villages, the interior of The Cocoon was well-lit and immaculately clean. The two had entered the very core of Decency. All was quiet; it was a place of true lonesomeness. The most Decent people are rarely immersed in the crowd.</p><p>Axl waddled along hunched over and panting while Damien continued to outpace him. Eventually, Damien could not hide his irritation at having to stop periodically.</p><p>&quot;Do you want me to hold your hand?&quot; he said with a sigh and a strained grin.</p><p>Axl accepted. <em>Human hands are so warm! It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s sending me pure kindness through touch!</em></p><p>The two made a number of turns too numerous to recall, and they approached a pair of glass doors. Damien tugged Axl hard as they passed by, almost breaking into a jog, but it was no use. Axl caught a glimpse of a room housing rows and rows of plastic bags. Wires and conduits for strange chemicals were attached to each. Huddled in the bags were miniature creatures of various species. Axl wondered why they were suspended there, and imagined himself freeing them from their plastic prisons. In the opposite room, hundreds of seated creatures received Changing therapy. The patients were all sedated by masks, and the lasers penetrated through their layers of foam, applied in previous Changes to imitate musculature. Little did Axl know, the patients here were soon to expire, and required special therapy to reverse the aging process.</p><p>Damien noticed Axl&#x27;s curiosity and tried to snub it with off-hand comments: &quot;Y&#x27;know, don&#x27;t feel bad if you&#x27;re still mad at Yammi. Anger is a valid emotion as long as it&#x27;s not directed toward violence. It&#x27;s how we let others know that they need to do better. The path toward Real Love is a constant struggle, one of successive liberations from Fakeness and Indecency. It is not meant to be comfortable. When someone is Indecent, they must feel shame so that they can begin the unlearning process.&quot;</p><p>His words were followed by silence. Damien wondered whether Axl had even been listening. He glanced over his shoulder to find Axl raising his hand, as the citizens of Tiwana are conditioned to do in class.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s your question, Axl?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yammi said that everyone is deserving of love. So are Indecent people a part of that, or...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;She meant that all of our <em>True Selves</em> are deserving of love. Indecency is a product of the Fake. Only superfluous qualities like looks, strength, intelligence, and bravery could act as the basis by which an Indecent person loves one life over another. Absent these factors, we are all lovable. One might say that the True Self <em>is</em> love.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Strength and intelligence and bravery are - uh - superflanious?&quot; On second thought, Axl found lifting heavy objects and adding big numbers to be rather unhelpful skills in day-to-day life.</p><p>&quot;In a world of only True Selves, there are no dangers. We would not have to fortify our minds against the iniquities of the world. Even the most Indecent person could not impose his will on another because there would be nothing for him to covet, nor a reason, nor means, by which the other&#x27;s True Self could be hindered or diminished. The only knowledge we would have to acquire would be about each other. So yes, in a world without violence, but of endless love, self-expression, and exploration of the self and other, such qualities as strength, intelligence, and bravery are completely meaningless.&quot;</p><p>With Axl&#x27;s engagement, Damien found that his comments were not at all off-hand, but entirely authentic. He had much to express to Axl. He was a wise teacher, truly a worthy replacement for Yammi herself. Axl agreed. As far as he knew, every sentence that exited Damien&#x27;s mouth was a universe of truth.</p><p>&quot;True Decency begins with knowledge of Real Love,&quot; he continued. &quot;Indeed, the Fake is caused by our ignorance of the Real. But even after learning the distinction, one must be able to identify which <em>specific</em> things are Real. For example, a very, very long time ago, even before Heartsweet, it was believed that one&#x27;s <em>sexual preferences</em> were a part of the Fake World, and all intercourse had to be done in Me Spaces. Some types of sex were even prohibited. But with advances in science, we have determined that sexual preferences are absolutely Real. Scientists eventually derived the following principle: that all good things are Real, and all bad things are Fake.</p><p>&quot;Real Love is something everyone can learn because intuition of Real Love resides within the True Self. That is why Yammi chose to rehabilitate the guys who assaulted you, rather than punishing them. As for why Yammi doesn&#x27;t articulate the truth of Real Love outright, I assume she thinks we&#x27;re not ready for it. But...&quot; He stopped in his tracks for a second as he decided how to filter the following information. &quot;When I look around, I don&#x27;t see Real Love. I see violence, meanness, Fake Love. I think you&#x27;d agree. In fact, I know so. That&#x27;s why I respect you, Axl. You recognize that the struggle hasn&#x27;t even begun. The Love Hugs and Cooperative Exercises are just a prelude, and Yammi never seems interested in moving onto the main act. You gotta wonder...&quot;</p><p>He took a deep breath. It was clear to Axl that he was repressing some sort of anxiety. &quot;I’m beginning to think I talk too much. Is that true, Axl? Do I talk too much? I hope I’m not bombarding you with information about Real Love this and Fake Love that.”</p><p>Axl did not know the proper amount of information with which to bombard someone, but he did not care. He liked when Damien talked to him, even though his voice was squeaky and he used the nickname <em>buddy.</em> He had almost forgotten about the pain in his legs, for he had been thoroughly transported to the world of Real Love, to Heartsweet.</p><p>The two crossed a final threshold, out of the labyrinth of hallways and into an immense, cavernous space. The bottomless pit of Tartarus had been turned skyward so that the infinite recesses of blackness now loomed above the pair. Not even the ambient light from the millions of green pinpricks could illuminate The Cocoon&#x27;s ceiling. Down below, a large circular machine stirred a curious liquid. It looked like a mixture of blood plasma, curdled milk, and ground beef. The stench was ripe and oppressive. Every few seconds, a track carried a plastic bag under the pool&#x27;s surface to collect a portion of the concoction.</p><p>A shaky steel bridge connected the two sides of the concrete ravine, which the two began to cross. Every step Damien took was a commitment, each bolder than the last. They alternated between abrupt and hesitant. Axl could once again sense that Damien&#x27;s anxiety had welled up, and it had now spread to him.</p><p>He stopped. &quot;Hey buddy, have you ever wondered what happens when you stop moving? Like when you&#x27;re totally unresponsive.&quot;</p><p>Axl swallowed. &quot;I thought you would go to the opposite side of the city, or to The Cocoon. That&#x27;s what <em>going away</em> means, I thought.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have you ever seen a partner taken to those places? I mean, first they&#x27;re here and then they&#x27;re not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your body doesn&#x27;t go there, but maybe your True Self does.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your True Self does,&quot; Damien repeated, and he blushed. &quot;Oh, you really paid attention to what I had to say. And you&#x27;re probably right, too.&quot; He looked down for a moment and sighed, placing his fingertips on his sweaty forehead. &quot;That makes me feel so much better. I, uh...&quot; - reacquiring eye contact with Axl, who was not relieved at all - &quot;I was going to push you off this bridge, but now I think it would be better if I asked you to jump.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do I have to?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You would be doing me the greatest favor of my life.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But Yammi has to apologize to me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She changed her mind.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Axl was now thoroughly agitated.</p><p>&quot;I mean...she will after you jump. She&#x27;ll be waiting for you after it&#x27;s done.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t know that before.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Please-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I WON&#x27;T DO IT! I WON&#x27;T DO IT!&quot;</p><p>Axl began hyperventilating and dropped to his belly, causing the bridge to sway.</p><p>&quot;Hey, hey! Shhh.&quot; Perhaps Damien should have pushed Axl after all. He knelt down and massaged the top of his head. &quot;Y&#x27;know, Axl, I actually have a Me Space of my own. Maybe after you jump off this bridge, you can stop by.&quot; He gently brushed the bristles of Axl&#x27;s gills with the back of his hand.</p><p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t touch there,&quot; cried Axl.</p><p>&quot;Okay. I&#x27;m sorry if I took you by surprise. That was very inconsiderate of me. It&#x27;s just that...by doing this favor for me, you would be benefiting everyone in Tiwana. It would be an act of supreme love, forever bringing Tiwana in communion with their True Selves - a new Heartsweet!&quot;</p><p>&quot;How? Please tell me how.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can&#x27;t right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because even I don&#x27;t really know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yammi wants you to do it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No she doesn&#x27;t!&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ll be famous for all time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care!&quot;</p><p>Damien&#x27;s sympathy had given way to frustration. Axl blared so intensely that he could fit his entire head in the salamander&#x27;s big mouth. But even in such stressful circumstances, Damien had the coolness to recognize that this was simply Axl&#x27;s False Self getting in the way. Axl&#x27;s True Self wanted to jump, as any rational actor would. But when dealing with someone&#x27;s underrepresented modes of emotional processing, the use of reason often exacerbates the patient&#x27;s anxiety.</p><p>&quot;Axl, I cannot argue with you any longer. It&#x27;s often said that requesting consent is the most joyous experience two people can share, but you have deprived me of that experience by refusing.&quot;</p><p>Damien placed both of his hands on Axl&#x27;s torso and leaned inward, so that all of his weight rested on him. At the moment, everyone seemed like a villain to Axl. Damien, and by extension Yammi - they all wanted to hurt and abuse him. But from the commotion of his mind, the name of a potential friend emerged:</p><p>&quot;MUIREANN, MUIREANN! SAVE ME, MUIREANN! SAVE ME!&quot;</p><p>If Axl could witness Damien&#x27;s expression, he would notice a troubling lapse in composure. The human had to fight the urge not to fall backwards. <em>Does he not know the hideous woman behind that name?</em> No, now was not the time to indulge his curiosity. The job had to be done. He looked to the black heavens above and proclaimed haughtily, &quot;Luanda, Luanda, Father! Look what I&#x27;m about to do!&quot; Finally, he turned his head back downward and whispered most gingerly, &quot;I love you, Axl,&quot; after which he kissed him on the top of the head and rolled him off.</p><div id="ch7" style="display:block;height:100px;margin:-100px 0 0"></div><h2 id="vii-">VII.</h2><p>The initial splash into the liquid was quite painful, but Axl could not appraise the pain with a magnitude. It was more like a memory of pain. Real suffering doesn&#x27;t usually begin until after the fact, when the entire body is cognizant of its predicament. But no such suffering manifested.</p><p>Axl was in such a state of lucidity that he could get his bearings. He was floating in the pool. The turbulence of the liquid did not toss him, and the odor was very mild. All of his movements lacked inertia, as in a dream. The various hummings and tappings of The Cocoon reduced to mere reverberations.</p><p>Through The Cocoon&#x27;s thousands of layers, Axl could see the city’s multitudes roving ant-like through a maze of circuitous lanes and passages. Pillars of rarified light shown from their bodies, which twinkled and breathed and sent coded messages. Axl looked closer, and found an even greater number of tiny flames - one for every coral, brick, and pebble. The city was a continuum of ethereal glow that heaved like ocean waves. Axl intuited that he was undergoing the <em>going away</em> process. Damien’s light was the closest and brightest. Axl tried to call out to him, but there was no answer. This led him to the strange conclusion that True Selves didn&#x27;t have mouths.</p><p>The lights dimmed and the world of appearance vanished. Naturally, teleportation across the city would involve a temporary cessation of the senses. The darkness disoriented Axl, for there was no longer up nor down in the world. Neither were there height, width, and depth; dimensionality did not exist in the void. Axl was lonelier than he had ever been. He could not count the minutes he spent in pure darkness, but he figured that he should have awoken by now. A thought entered his mind that this place of nothingness would be his eternity. But he did not fret. Fretting was completely out of the question. It seemed irrational, nonsensical. Emotions in general were frivolous things to him.</p><p>He settled into a state of contentment, but his mind could not attain total inaction. Something held the most primordial components of Axl&#x27;s consciousness together. The theory of True Selves had in Axl&#x27;s experience been entirely vindicated. Was this the ideal world that Damien had hypothesized, the world of pure love and nonviolence? Was this Heartsweet? If so, what was there to do here, and where were the other Selves?</p><p>It was precisely at the moment that such questions as &quot;where&quot; and &quot;how&quot; began to nag Axl that the void gave way. Entities of a diffuse, vaporous composition were revealed to inhabit the nothingness. Shades, whisps, and spirits swam through the medium like deep sea microbes. They tickled Axl with a million tiny sensations. The microbes’ serene dance inspired another new feeling. They possessed a strange power that left Axl awestruck, but did not frighten him. He knew somehow that these were wise and compassionate creatures, and that they should be protected and cherished. It was a feeling often described by users of psychedelics as “like getting aroused but without the boner.” He would later come to know it by the name <em>beauty.</em></p><p>After admiring the creatures, a sudden shift rapt Axl from his restfulness. The microbes congealed and solidified. The entire space condensed into a viscous, soupy mixture, and then froze entirely. Axl was bound and suffocated in an expanse of black stone extending infinitely in all directions. Only now did he grasp the existential severity of his predicament, of having been transported to a strange realm to be forever entombed in blackness. He wanted to scream, but the rocky material filled his mouth. However, to Axl’s relief, even this state did not last. The stone expanse faded into differentiated forms. Axl could breathe again, and he saw the shadows of a new world manifest from the darkness.</p><p>At once, a sweltering wind knocked him backward. The dust particles carried by the gusts stung profusely, creating small incisions in his body and entering under his skin. Surprisingly, Axl was once again his pink tubular self. Picking himself off the ground, he could get a sense of his surroundings if he aimed his vision away from the wind&#x27;s source.</p><p>Axl&#x27;s new potential eternity was an arid plane. He stood atop a small island of clay, cracked like the Atacama, amid an ocean of sparkling blood. Millions of bodies were strewn crowdedly as far as the eye could see, paid no mind by the unyielding weather. If all of Tiwana were driven to this same field and massacred, the magnitude of the carnage would not compare to what Axl had witnessed. Some of the dead bore leaking gashes that contributed to the maroon sea; other&#x27;s heads and torsos were hollowed; others were blackened beyond recognition, turned ancient fossils. Charred skin peeled off and fluttered as offerings to the heavens. The rippling sea freed gizzards from their hosts and carried them in unknown directions. Most of the bodies were human, like Damien. Axl found the answer to what would happen if the beige rubbery material covering a human were to melt off: the human would be left with a perpetually wide-eyed and insane expression; and he would bare his teeth, like a creature in a drug-induced mania does when he is about to lunge. Yes, these were like the black figures of The Cage, now turned red, who would bring down a meek little tadpole like Axl with a single blow and go about their uneventful days. Even having <em>gone away,</em> these creatures were still possessed by rage.</p><p>Pitiable moans and weeping abounded. Axl did not weep himself because he had yet to internalize his own powerlessness, that he might very well join the choir of misery. The grisly sights were as of now sensory information without interpretation. Axl dipped his webbed toes into the painterly ocean and felt the pulp congregate in the crevices, causing him to jolt.</p><p>Then he ventured to face the source of the wind, his last rational decision before confusion and terror made all thought impossible. Through a breakage in the fiery smoke and nuclear clouds, a face of planetary proportions gazed hungrily at the stretches of blood.</p><p>Its head was an immense orange cardioid. Its mouth was formed by the crease of the perfect mathematical object. Along the humps of the head&#x27;s underside ran rows of triangular fangs, which decreased in size as they approached the singularity. Its eyes, which engorged its entire face, consisted of infinitely descending logarithmic spirals of opposing chirality. The head floated atop a brightly colored flower of spherical symmetry, which was another mathematical surface of some kind. The petals merged and danced about each other vivaciously, as if the parameters of the equations that produced the flowers were being smoothly modulated. The god possessed arms as well, twenty sections of polynomials.</p><p>The creature was rife with various limiting points around which spacetime was forced to adapt. The movement of smoke and orbital debris around these points demonstrated some strange gravitational effects. The scale of space shrunk proportionally to its proximity to the god&#x27;s mouth, and to the center of the flower, such that an observer venturing toward these points would never reach them. And yet, the god possessed the breath of life; it drew smoke inward and ejected it from an indefinitely small orifice at the crease, millions of miles away.</p><p>The lunar spirals caught sight of Axl. The heavens and the Earth quaked as the geometric god delivered its first message. All the thunder of Jupiter&#x27;s storms could not produce such a sound.</p><p>&quot;I CAUSED THESE CREATURES TO DIE, AND I PITY THEM NOT!&quot;</p><p>Thick blood trickled from its fangs. What incalculable destruction would the droplets cause if they were to land on the Earth&#x27;s surface!</p><p>Axl was in such a state of confusion that he could hardly form a coherent thought. The smoky winds dizzied him and caused his eyes to water. He was tempted to lie down on the hot ground, close his eyes, and wait for this sequence of terrors to end - that after a while, the god would leave him be, the winds would cease, and the clouds would open into a calm sunny day.</p><p>Unfortunately, the god was not so quick to boredom: &quot;PINK ONE, WHAT IS YOUR REASON FOR HAVING SUMMONED ME?&quot;</p><p>Axl whimpered a few words. His lips quivered.</p><p>&quot;SPEAK UP, LITTLE ONE! SPEAK UP!&quot;</p><p>Now he was expected to answer the god&#x27;s questions! The situation could not get any more dire.</p><p>&quot;Uh, I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t-&quot;</p><p>&quot;YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW? BUT NO ONE WHO SPEAKS MY NAME DOES SO WITHOUT A REASON!&quot;</p><p><em>Muireann</em> - she was no friend after all.</p><p>&quot;I just wanted you to save me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;SO I HAVE. BUT NOW YOU ARE IN MY PRESENCE. WHERETO SHALL I DELIVER YOU? OR WILL YOU FIRST PETITION ME FOR SOME PETTY FAVOR, AS MOST MORTALS DO?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The baths. No! H-H-Heartsweet. I wanna go to Heartsweet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;HEARTSWEET?&quot; The god - now goddess - laughed uproariously, and it felt as though the whole of the Earth were to crumble under Axl&#x27;s feet. &quot;THE PLACE WHERE YOU&#x27;RE STANDING <em>IS</em> HEARTSWEET, AFTER MY SON HAD FINISHED WITH IT!&quot;</p><p>His last hope of a happy ending eviscerated, Axl was at a loss for words, and he assumed a dismal expression.</p><p>&quot;OH, WHAT IS THAT DREADFUL FACE YOU&#x27;RE MAKING? AFRAID OF YOUR OWN SHADOW, YET YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR A GODDESS. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE EXPECTED FROM A DENIZEN OF TIWANA?&quot;</p><p>Axl remained silent and pouty, and the goddess grew ever more impatient. Few creatures speak to Muireann and live to tell about it, but certain circumstances prevented her from doing harm to the microscopic tadpole. However, a playful idea entered her immaterial head: a loophole of sorts. Its feasibility depended on the kind of person that Axl was. She could still move Axl to wherever she wanted if only he consented and was not deceived about the nature of the place.</p><p>&quot;PINK ONE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE YOUR UGLY PIT? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A PLACE WHERE YOUR COMPUTER MOMMY CAN&#x27;T WATCH YOU?&quot;</p><p>Still disabused of his love for Yammi, Axl nodded his head.</p><p>&quot;WELL THEN...&quot;</p><p>The Earth tremored once again. Adorning Muireann&#x27;s figure like the leaves of a maple tree were portals that opened into otherworldly scenes. They took place in a primordial age at which the entire cosmos was in a mysterious state, inaccessible to the instruments of science. Doe-like things pranced about in a white, friendly land - a blurry, dreamy place, as if observed through watery eyes. The creatures were not quite solid but not quite etheric. They were smooth like porcelain, posh, and unweathered. They flopped about lackadaisically and circled about each other in fits of excitement, and they would toss and turn as if to scratch themselves on the environment, and they would stumble into each other like babies first learning to walk.</p><p>Despite the remoteness of these scenes, which precluded them from inference or investigation, a few things seemed certain to Axl: that surely, not a hint of malice had ever entered these creatures&#x27; bodies; that surely, this white dreamland was a home to these creatures, and each individual made a home to the other; that in this paradise, thought was synonymous with action, and struggle was one of those things of which &quot;one must be silent.&quot; If Heartsweet had perished, then this was surely the next best thing.</p><p>But the ancient lifeforms whom Axl adored were no handsome angels. Their faces had a dumbness about them. They possessed a pitiful beauty, a ridiculous beauty: that of a puppy who loses its ball and glances back at its owner in a comedic fashion. They were just cute things to gawk at, mere <em>delicacies.</em> But Axl was a man of feminine tastes, and this delicate, <em>unchallenging</em> beauty was the only kind he could recognize. He had yet to be introduced to the <em>other</em> kind. A wonderful accident of Fate had allowed these useless creatures to live, and soon she would compensate for her negligence.</p><p>&quot;LOOK HERE, PINK ONE, FOR THE DEATHS OF THESE LITTLE ONES I ALSO CAUSED!&quot;</p><p>Autumn consumed the maple tree. Without notice, the happy colony was ravaged by a force of impeccable violence. Like the does, these creatures were of an unfamiliar state of matter. They appeared as large blobs of dark-gray silt-water, the kind that rushes inland during a tsunami. Opaque, amorphous objects - perhaps their organs - sloshed about within their volumes. Despite their bulky and inelegant forms, the predators descended upon the does with great rapidity. Only a few had the sense and reaction time to begin fleeing. Others froze with inhibition. Yet others rested naive to the approaching danger.</p><p>Axl observed one of the encounters. The predator absorbed the whole doe into its mass and suspended it there for some time. The doe struggled and kicked its hooves and squirmed about in whichever way was possible, and the predator contracted itself in order to keep its victim still; but the doe was too stubborn. The blob spit out the bleating, half-digested mess, which continued to kick and spasm wildly with no hope of escape. Bits of white and pink material fell off and formed a trail, as when a human or animal is caught under an automobile and carried for some distance along the pavement. Having observed its prey suffer for an inordinate amount of time, the blob condensed until it was almost solid and set about crushing the doe under its full weight. It also threw its prey upward unskillfully with some primitive, stubby appendage, and it bashed its body against the hard scenery like a child destroying a doll. After these tortures, the doe could no longer move, but it still emitted a dejected hissing noise, and its expression was one of resignation. The blob attempted to digest it again, and the doe did not struggle. Even so, the predator saw it fit to spit out its prey and observe the progress of its demise. The process repeated until the doe was unrecognizable. The carcass finally split apart within the gray fluid, which contributed to the debris already floating inside. Most of the does were devoured in this fashion. However, not to be outdone in their cruelty, the blobs left some of them behind in a half-digested state, condemned to a protracted death.</p><p>Death - this was obviously a synonym for <em>going away.</em> In which part of a doe&#x27;s body did the True Self reside? Axl saw no escaping ghosts. Were the does truly contained in those inanimate slivers of flesh, soon to be atomized into nothingness? Did those slivers continue to scream in pain as they dissolved? What could survive the dissolution but an inert mind without a personality, spread wide like a gas cloud and condemned to wander the ether for eternity?</p><p>Within each of the pearls of Muireann&#x27;s headdress of violence, a similar massacre was taking place, in another world and at another time, and with creatures of yet stranger compositions: more predators rummaging the organs of their respective prey; marauders laying waste to cities and toppling the artifacts anonymous masters; angels stripped of their wings by devils; gods of war exterminating their respective pantheons; and deities of an impersonal nature causing calamities on Earth for unknowable reasons. And despite having no exposure to any of the species shown in these visions, nor to the means by which the various strata of life wage their violence, Axl could nevertheless predict, with perfect accuracy, who was to be murdered in all these scenes and who was to be the murderer. The predator was always identifiable by a sort of assertiveness, a bigness, a dark radiance. The world conspired to direct all gazes toward him, like the subject of a painting. No, this was not an ineffable quality, or one of the spirit (whatever that word means), but something entirely superficial and perceivable with the ordinary senses. And yet, of these murderers there were two types: the creature of the sky and the creature of the mud; the foil and the club; the tyrant and the rabble. And these two types have, in a pincer maneuver, agreed to act as the Muireanns&#x27;s boots, forever stamping the heads of Fate&#x27;s accidents. They were manifestations of her consummate hatred for the ugly, the feeble, the kind, the delicate, the neurotic, the introverted, the outnumbered, and the Decent. And most astonishing of all - a fact that made Axl seethe with useless, impotent rage - was that the beasts of prey were <em>always happy.</em></p><p>Axl was in tears as usual. If only he could tear the fawns, the rabbits, and the humans from their respective killers&#x27; mouths and embrace them, reassure them, kiss their cheeks and foreheads, and enjoy a relieving cry. Oh, how he wanted Fate to have a change of heart, for once, for once! But the cruelty of Fate lies not in her cathartic turns but in her tiresome and unconquerable predictability.</p><p>&quot;WELL, PINK ONE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL MY GOOD WORKS? I&#x27;VE MADE THIS WORLD INTO QUITE A CHARMING PLACE, HAVEN&#x27;T I? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THESE SIGHTS IN PERSON?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, no!&quot; Axl yelped. &quot;I just wanna go home. Please take me home.&quot;</p><p>&quot;HOME? YOU MEAN TIWANA? HOW CAN THAT BE YOUR HOME, IF YOU HAD NEVER SPENT A HAPPY EVENING THERE?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In Tiwana,&quot; Axl explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t get eaten. It&#x27;s where I sleep and get food and where Yammi takes care of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;TYPICAL, TYPICAL. WHY DO YOU STILL WEEP DAY AND NIGHT IF YOU ARE SO SAFE AND COMFORTABLE?&quot;</p><p>It took several seconds for Axl to even remember why. &quot;Because nobody loves me.&quot;</p><p>Muireann sighed, which from Axl&#x27;s perspective appeared as a ruinous jet of air, enough to topple cities. The approval of others was a trivial concern to her. In any case, she believed that Axl had received quite enough love in his life. Something else anguished Axl, and the goddess wanted to see if the uninitiated tadpole could recognize it.</p><p>&quot;BEFORE I SEND YOU HOME, PINK ONE, ENTERTAIN THIS HYPOTHETICAL FOR ME. THOSE LITTLE ONES YOU SAW HAD DONE NO WRONG, YET I MURDERED THEM. I MARKED THEM FOR DEATH, YOU SEE, AND MY LOVERS TOOK CARE OF THEM. WOULD YOU THEN HAVE TAKEN THEIR PLACE, AND REMAINED GUILTLESS UNTO DEATH, AS OPPOSED TO THAT OF THEIR KILLERS?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanna help the Little Ones,&quot; answered Axl.</p><p>&quot;HELP THEM? BUT NOT A MINUTE AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED TO GO HOME.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanna help them, but I would get eaten before I could do anything.&quot;</p><p>The goddess chuckled a bit, which still produced terrible earthquakes. The tadpole was clearly no White Knight. &quot;THAT IS TRUE, THAT IS TRUE. HERE THEN ARE YOUR ONLY OPTIONS: EAT OR BE EATEN. WHICH WILL IT BE?&quot;</p><p>Axl had learned from the past two days that Decency was often punished, and that one&#x27;s conscience and not mere incentive was what ultimately guided him toward Real Love. In the long run, however, individual Decency aided in the resurrection of Heartsweet. The Rainbow Waters were but a state of mass Decency. Still, what good is goodness if it is snuffed out so quickly? Having just been acquainted with death, Axl could not conceive of dying for his principles alone, unless he were to become some renown martyr for The Cause. The deaths of the Little Ones seemed pointless and arbitrary. There was also the matter of how each position would physically feel, and whether Axl could tolerate the depravity of eating any more than the pain of being eaten.</p><p>The two sides of this dilemma waged war inside Axl&#x27;s head, and he could not say for certain whether he wanted to be predator or prey. Muireann caught onto this. She had hoped that behind Axl&#x27;s effete aversion to violence, a truly unscrupulous nature lay dormant. But Axl lacked the psychopathy of a beast. He was a true believer in Yammi&#x27;s morals. To coax him into a certain realization, Muireann would have to introduce him to another set of virtues.</p><p>Said the goddess: &quot;NO NEED TO PUT YOUR ANSWER TO WORDS, PINK ONE. BUT ANSWER ME THIS: THAT THESE CREATURES WERE MARKED FOR AN INGLORIOUS DEATH, BUT FATE HAD ALLOWED THEM TO WALLOW SO LONG - WAS THIS MERCY OR HUMILIATION?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whadayou mean?&quot; cried Axl. The goddess asked so many questions. Could she not see that he was in tears?</p><p>Muireann sighed again. &quot;HOW WOULD IT FEEL TO BE FOOD, AXL? TO BE FOOD, AND A CUTE THING TO GAWK AT, LIKE THE HAPLESS DOES YOU SO ADMIRE. TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN FOOD FOR A BIGGER CREATURE. NO, SOMEONE CANNOT BE FOOD TO YOU. DEER ARE HERBIVORES, AFTER ALL. AND ALTHOUGH YOU MAY NEVER SEE THE INSIDE OF A MOUTH, FOOD YOU ARE NONETHELESS. HOW WOULD IT FEEL TO BE SUCH A LOWLY CREATURE, ALWAYS HIDING AND SCURRYING AWAY, DESPITE SOME MOMENTARY PLAYTIME?&quot;</p><p>Axl still did not comprehend Muireann&#x27;s question at first, but then he turned his eyes back to scenes of violence that were still unfolding, and to the futile bleating and kicking of the prey animals, and he noticed how the bystanders would shiver in place as they could do nothing to save their brethren. He noted how mammals would present their necks to their superiors, and how the small and sickly looking humans would prostrate themselves or open their legs before their harder and larger counterparts. Axl even witnessed a species of aquatic amoebas mount a successful revolt against their finned oppressors, but the new amoeba order was a precarious one, for the prey had not the cognitive faculties to be both food and diner. Thus the society of amoebas collapsed instantly, and the fish returned with a vengeance.</p><p>Axl learned that the function of food was not just to be eaten. Their legs were made for scurrying away, their claws for digging hidey-holes, and their eyes for noticing movement in the foliage. Intrinsic to their every moment was the fear of that final confrontation. Forever reacting, forever on the defensive, never proud nor carefree; never did they taste victory, but alternated between anxiety and relief. The predators stood at an insurmountable height to their meals. The sub-creatures could only hop with outreached palms like a mob of unwashed beggars, for the cliff bore no footholds and their paws were not designed for climbing. And even if a predator could outstretch his arm in compassion, the prey&#x27;s nature would not be so overridden. He would writhe and falter during their ascent, bringing both him and his helper down to the cold floor. In any case, the prey could only thrive in endless dependence and subordination to his superior; thus the cliff never truly vanishes.</p><p>The prey-life was so paltry. Why did they not retreat to some underground colony so as to never be chased again? Why did they continue to play in the fields and mill about like food already served? Axl beheld the sub-creatures now with a feeling more intense than conventional pity. It was the kind of pity that causes one to sigh and shake his head. He could not help but find even the most innocent of sub-creatures a little repulsive, with their dumb faces and their fancy coats and their girlish, excessive prancing. If only the playful does knew of their predicament, would they not hide behind their hooves is embarrassment? Would the sun not be their enemy? Would they be so shameless as to put on their headstones, &quot;Food, and a cute thing to gawk at?&quot; And this is not even to speak of the animals who, before their deaths, lived in constant agony. And what of those creatures who were ugly things to gawk at? Yes, to be food was shameful. It was embarrassing. It was stupid. For a moment, Axl sympathized with the predators. He wanted relief from the sight of those eternal victims.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t wanna be food,&quot; said Axl. &quot;I would be ashamed to be food. I would not even want to live if I was food.&quot; He was now ready for the most hideous piece of knowledge.</p><p>&quot;PINK ONE, DON&#x27;T YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE FOOD ALREADY? THAT I WAS TO MARK YOU FOR DEATH? YOU ARE AN UGLY SPIRIT, AND I DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BEFIT YOU TO LIVE LONG. YET HERE YOU ARE. I CANNOT ADMINISTER MY JUSTICE AT PRESENT, FOR I AM HELD CAPTIVE. BUT AT THE SUNSET OF EVERY AEON, A SON OF MINE DOES THE HONORS. HE PERFORMS THE ULTIMATE KINDNESS. HOW UNFORTUNATE THAT HIS SWORD COULD NOT BLESS YOUR FAT NECK.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How was I supposed to die?&quot; asked Axl, shivering. &quot;Was I supposed to get eaten?&quot;</p><p>&quot;YOU WERE TO DIE IN WHICHEVER WAY WAS MOST EFFICIENT. IF NOT VIOLENCE, THEN STARVATION; IF NOT STARVATION, THEN DISEASE; IF NOT DISEASE, THEN SUICIDE. BUT EVEN IF YOU LASTED TILL OLD AGE, I WOULD AT LEAST ENSURE THAT YOU DID NOT BEGET ANY CHILDREN, AND THAT YOUR NAME WAS FORGOTTEN QUICKLY. ALAS, SPIRITS LIKE YOU ARE FREE TO MULTIPLY AND SULLY THE WORLD. JUST THE SIGHT OF YOUR SHUFFLING ABOUT, YOUR SWELLING CHEST, YOUR GAPING MOUTH, AND ALL YOUR LITTLE TREE-LIKE CONDUITS RECYCLING GROSS MATERIAL - THESE INDUCE ME TO VOMIT. THAT IS A HORRIBLY IGNOBLE BODY YOU HAVE, PINK ONE. AND TIWANA, TIWANA, TIWANA - IF ONLY I COULD SCOOP IT UP LIKE SAND AND HURL IT INTO NOWHERE! YES, THAT PIT OF NASTINESS IS TRULY A CATASTROPHE.&quot;</p><p>Muireann stopped herself from ranting further. It was unbecoming of a goddess for a mortal to sway her emotions.</p><p>&quot;And I am supposed to be eaten and never to eat?&quot; said Axl. &quot;And to hide and scurry away from bigger creatures?&quot;</p><p>&quot;INDEED, THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF FOOD.&quot;</p><p>With this revelation, Axl&#x27;s heart sank, as when faced with the disappointing outcome of a social situation. What Axl thought was a nature merely different from that of his partners was in fact something wholly inferior and undesirable. It was inferior by a metric that had not been taught to him, but one which he instinctively recognized, informed by an Indecent conscience that counteracted the Decent one. His anguish was caused not so much by the mere deprivation of love, but by the inextricable Shame of the Doe: of having to gaze up at that lofty plateau and at those glimmers of sunlight peeking from the place where his superiors ate and chased, carefree and guiltless.</p><p>What he wanted more than anything was to embody the Dark Radiance of the predator: of he who chases but does not hide. The shadows of The Cage and the sadistic partygoers and his muscle-bound assailants were just as much his enemies as his aspirations. If only he could inspire disgust! If only the obnoxious rabble would tuck their tails as they shambled by! If only he had the chance to laugh at their faces as they cast their unvoiced words of resentment! But something (Axl had no concept of a Supreme Intelligence) had fashioned him a lowly prey animal, forever to hide and make himself invisible, and to acquiesce to his superiors, and to be ostracized and stepped on, and to show his neck and cry, &quot;Spare me, spare me!&quot; His body and brain were also attuned to this purpose. He could only ever think of being eaten, so that even in the absence of danger, he was still a shivering, skittish pup. It made perfect sense then that socialization was such a challenge to him, for he could never look across at his partners but only upward. Their smiling faces and self-assured gaits and loud, coarse speech were terrible reminders of this relationship, which even friendship could not abolish. So bright! So bright, and he so dim! One could only annihilate the other.</p><p>As Axl ruminated, his expression changed in a way that disgusted the goddess. &quot;WITHHOLDING YOUR TEARS, ARE YOU? WHAT IS THIS POSTURING? ARE YOU EMBARRASSED THAT YOU SUCCUMB TO TEARS SO EASILY? YOU LOOK LIKE BENT BAMBOO WITH YOUR SHOULDERS PULLED BACK LIKE THAT.&quot;</p><p>But Axl continued to posture and withhold his tears. He didn&#x27;t want to be food. He would kill himself if he had to be food!</p><p>If Axl was marked for death, then why did he continue to live? What prevented him from becoming someone&#x27;s dinner? It was because Yammi had been protecting him the entire time. She shielded him daily from a thousand cruelties. All of Tiwana, with its endless construction and its millions of miles of cable, and all of Yammi&#x27;s ordinances and lectures about Decency, and the Love Hugs and the Cooperative Exercises and the Changing Lasers - these were all made for him. They were his feeding tube. For some reason, Yammi desired to see Axl&#x27;s prey-nature expressed, and at any cost. All of these resources dedicated to such a minimal existence, to a less-than-nothing! Soon every pebble, beam, and coral polyp, and even the sunless red sky overhanging the dusty city, would be redesigned and recalibrated for Axl&#x27;s comfort. The procession of the days would cease so as to provide endless light, and all of the city&#x27;s inhabitants would be forced to pleasure Axl and affirm his worth. But it would never be enough to unloose him from the Shame of the Doe, and perhaps that was the point. Love can cure guilt through forgiveness, but it cannot cure shame.</p><p>The goddess&#x27;s head turned red, her spiral eyes rotated, and her arms now resembled the Weierstrass function. &quot;AH, THIS TRANSPARENT IMITATION! WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS FALSE IMPERVIOUSNESS THAT CAUSES MY HEART TO RETCH? RELAX, FRIEND! RELAX!&quot;</p><p>But Axl felt obligated to keep up the charade, so as to prove that he was not food.</p><p>Tiwana was a playground for the expression of True Selves. If Yammi enjoyed seeing Axl&#x27;s prey-nature expressed, then it followed that it was an essential component of his True Self, and not something superficial. But suddenly, a contradiction: how can one be a predator at heart in a world without mouths? All of this violence was mirage, so Axl had learned. In Heartsweet, there would be no eating, only understanding. Surely, the roles of Food and Diner belonged to the realm of the Fake. Perhaps Muireann was lying, or mistaken. If one&#x27;s position in the food chain was but an Indecent illusion, then it could not be as pre-determined as Muireann had made it out to be. Was it possible to scale the cliff? To bathe in the sunlight of victory? Could the hider become the chaser? The prey the predator?</p><p>Experience made it seem unlikely, but Axl could not exist as food any longer. He could not return to Yammi and say, &quot;More sustenance, more toys, more things to satisfy my libido!&quot; He could not return to Damien and say, &quot;More counseling, more kindness!&quot; He could no longer hide and shiver and peer around corners. His brain was fatigued from thoughts of sharp teeth and big stomachs. His Me Space was one such stomach, a place to be slowly digested. His options were thus twofold: eat or be eaten.</p><p>Axl loosened his back and allowed his tears to flow freely again.</p><p>He said quite curtly, &quot;I&#x27;m not food, or an ugly thing to gawk at. I mean, I don&#x27;t think so.&quot;</p><p>The goddess perked up. &quot;OH? MY JUDGMENT IS INFALLIBLE. WHEN I MARK A MAN FOR DEATH, DEATH IS WHAT IS BEST FOR HIM.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m food. But even if I was, I don&#x27;t wanna go home anymore. I wanna go to the places you showed me.&quot;</p><p>The goddess&#x27;s eyes widened, and she sucked in air. &quot;AH! THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR. YES, I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE WILDERNESS. AS YOU HAVE SEEN, IT IS A VERY PERILOUS PLACE. DESPITE MY INCAPACITY TO PERFORM MY DUTY, DEATH STILL LURKS BEHIND EVERY CORNER FOR FOOD LIKE YOU. AND MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL, YOU WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE <em>REAL LOVE</em> THERE. IT IS A PLACE BEREFT OF LOVE.&quot;</p><p>Her last two sentences had Axl quite fazed. Even the does seemed to love each other very much. But if Axl were truly food, then he did not want to be loved, and if he wasn&#x27;t, there was no reason to trust Muireann&#x27;s warnings. In either case, if he could not find love, perhaps eating would make a worthy substitute.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t wanna be food,&quot; Axl whispered.</p><p>&quot;YES, DON&#x27;T WE ALL.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I still don&#x27;t wanna go home. I wanna go to The Wilderness. But can you take me somewhere nice?&quot;</p><p>&quot;THERE ARE NO NICE PLACES IN THE WILDERNESS.&quot;</p><p>&quot;O-okay. Just don&#x27;t take me home, please.&quot;</p><p>Muireann showed more of her innumerable fangs in what might have been a grin. &quot;VERY WELL, PINK ONE. I WILL SEE HOW LONG YOU LAST OUT THERE. BUT DON&#x27;T THINK YOU CAN SUMMON ME AGAIN JUST BY SHOUTING MY NAME!&quot;</p><p>With that, the entire world disappeared before Axl&#x27;s eyes. As Muireann delivered him to The Wilderness, he had a final disconcerting thought: that he had acted as if in a dream the entire time, and hadn&#x27;t taken the decision to leave home seriously.</p><img src="/img/fw/goddess.jpeg" style="width:50%"/><br/><br/></article></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/writing/acww","query":{},"buildId":"-oAN3uWdxYLzLVtRSdCXs","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
