When I first decided to write, I wanted to draw from my own experiences. As a result, the whole piece reeks of modern sensibilities and modern anxieties. The subject matter is mopey and political. I have no real problems in life; hence the problems in the book are fake and gay. By injecting my attitudes and neuroses into the work, and by turning the characters into mouthpieces for my psyche, I’ve created something very insular, egocentric, and infantile; something that discounts the totality of human experience, and amounts to holding a megaphone up to the reader’s ear and shouting about my feelings."}),(0,s.jsxs)("p",{children:["Somewhere along the line I decided I just wanted to write about cute animals.

The reason why there is so much dialogue in Book 0 is that I had too much to “get over with.” By the time Finn and Axl left the treehouse for good, I still had more to say, so I wrote a twenty page author’s note in which I wax philosophic and lambast myself for being a massive nerd. I was banking on the author’s notes developing into some kind of meta plotline, but I had no good ideas. Last night I attempted to incorporate the themes of the rant into a Book 0 Epilogue, but the scene with the duo in the treehouse was too much of a natural stopping point.
