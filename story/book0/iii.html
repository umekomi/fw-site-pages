He stood alone with his back against the wall and drink in hand. The round enclosure offered no corner in which to hide. The rest were seated on round stumps among sequin curtains, or reclined on piles of rainbow beanbags. An overweight human, an amoeba, and a salmon were cuddling and groping each other. The entire space was coated in purple, glittery rubber and sprayed with saccharine fragrances. Yammi would stretch the walls with her appendages and offer the partygoers firm caresses and headpats.</p><p>All of Axl’s teammates had coalesced, as if by gravitation, into their own cliques. Axl, alone, was burning in a Hell of drunken chatter: so obnoxious, so inconsiderate, so violent! What did these imbeciles have to say that was so important? And when the harsh noise wall erupted into shrieks of drunken laughter - oh! how his chest collapsed and his eyes scrunched up with nervous energy. Every impulse implored him to throw down his drink in righteous indignation and shout, “Enough!”</p><p>The sounds of carefree laughter and selfish camaraderie - these made Axl want to run as far away as possible, as if from a gang of young marauders to whom killing was as casual a pastime as throwing stones. Why did he subject himself to...? A moment of clarity caused Axl’s heart to sink: <i>I’m standing alone with my non-alcoholic beverage, when I should be making friends!!!</i> Just one real conversation – not a dispassionate exchange of “How’s it going?” or “Yammi was so great to me today!” but a mutual expression of shared interests, humor, et cetera – would invite the potential for a lifelong connection. But instead of introducing himself to someone, Axl merely thought about the possibility: how trivial it would be, but that he would never actually go through with it. Had Axl’s peers noticed that he was the only one standing alone? No, of course not. They didn’t need him, and he had nothing to add to their inane conversations.</p><p>Axl’s thoughts devolved into the typical spiral of recursive self-reflection, which in twenty or so years of life had failed to yield any action.  Axl was once a little grown-up, but now he was a child meagerly pretending. Making friends - such an infantile problem to have!</p><p>Just as he had renounced himself to his self-referential thought patterns did the sensation of another’s touch jolt him back into the physical world. It wasn’t Yammi, but a human. He was a short egghead with dour eyes, thin lips, and a high forehead upstaging oily black hair. He wore a pink sweater with generic cutesy symbols and a red pouch that resembled a diaper.</p><p>“Hey, buddy. I noticed you were all alone here. Is everything okay?” <i>Mind your own business!</i></p><p>“Fine. I’m fine.”</p><p>“Are you sure? You looked like you were about to cry for the past hour.”</p><p>“No! I wasn’t. I’m just very tired.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Do you remember who I am, Axl?”</p><p>After much hesitation, “No, I don’t. Sorry.”</p><p>“My name’s Damien. I’m your designated Character Counselor and Conflict Resolution Specialist. I make sure that everyone feels comfortable and respected in the Team Space.”</p><p>“Okay.” <i>Please leave, I don’t wanna talk to anyone right now.</i></p><p>“If you’re feeling hurt, mistreated, bullied, whatever, you can tell me everything, and I’ll be there to help. All right?”</p><p>“All right.” Axl was not speaking so much as sighing.</p><p>“Axl.” Damien’s voice became very serious. “Our records indicate that you are in great danger. <i>Emotional</i> danger, and it’s my duty to fix it! We must perform a deep dive, <i>together</i>, into the negative feelings you’re experiencing so we can uncover the root cause. This is a party, after all. You should be enjoying yourself!”</p><p>Axl saw no reason to object to Damien’s proposal. He was indeed having negative feelings. At worst, he could find relief in airing out his grievances. “You’re right, you’re right. Let’s do this.”</p><p>Damien inhaled deeply and began. “Axl, I was in your exact position when I was younger. I also struggled with social anxiety. So here’s my diagnosis: you’re suffering because you’re trapped in a limited, antiquated mindset. It’s called epigenetics: trauma from the past affecting the present. Now, that’s not to say your feelings aren’t valid, but society has outgrown them, and it’s up to you to liberate yourself.” He noticed that Axl wasn’t receiving his advice well, so he tried to sound gentle again. “I see a lot of intelligence in you, Axl. A lot for someone with a <i>Basic Education</i>. Why do <i>you</i> think you have trouble making friends?”</p><p>“Because I don’t know how to talk to people.”</p><p>“Is there a right way of talking to people?”</p><p>“Maybe...”</p><p>“What is Yammi’s one rule?”</p><p>“To be decent to each other.”</p><p>“And what are her other rules?”</p><p>Axl stared blankly, hoping that Damien would answer for him. Luckily, he did. “There are no other rules! Just be a decent person, that’s it. So, is there a right way of talking?”</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>“That’s right! There is no correct way of talking. <i>Glabolabolrrrrbbssspffffffttt.</i> See, I’m talking in my own style!”</p><p>Axl didn’t understand how this mockery of a Socratic dialogue was supposed to help him. Nevertheless, he was mesmerized by Damien’s apparent interest in his well being.</p><p>Damien continued. “The root of your problem - your social anxiety - is that there’s a mold you want to fit into, which isn’t your <i>true self.</i> You don’t want to emulate these brash, uh, braindead animals, right? Why do they have to make fun of each other and roughhouse each other and talk about their <i>flagella?</i>”</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry. It’s just that those individuals on the left bring them up in every conversation. It’s very obnoxious and unwarranted. I ought to file a report.&quot; Damien leaned on one foot and held his hand to his chin, surveying Axl from head to toe. “So what are you? A lizard?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I always looked like this.”</p><p>“So that’s your bag body? It’s very unique and matches your personality well. I love how you forgoed the muscles and <i>other</i> clichéd elements. But something sexier might boost your confidence.”</p><p>“Maybe, maybe.” Axl was too afraid to have a Change applied, but he understood the correlation between body and personality.</p><p>“Hehe, I know what you’re thinking. ‘That’s very ironic coming from you, Damien!’ Well, I’ve decided that the ugly me is the real me! The fat, the wrinkles, the modestly-sized tentacle - that’s the raw, unfiltered Damien! It is my source of pride. In a world of square jaws and big muscles, I’ve decided to break the mold. My face might look like a baked potato, but I can still pull off this style!” He wiggled his behind in Axl’s direction. “Oh, we went on a massive tangent! As I was saying, where is the intelligent discussion, the getting to know each other on a deeper level?” Axl nodded in agreement.</p><p>“So stop trying to associate with the fools! Remember Yammi’s one rule: be a decent person! Be decent, and no matter who you are, you’ll find people to connect with. When you encounter a group that fits your criteria, that’s when you put yourself out there.” Damien had to catch his breath from all the talking.</p><p>“And another point: talk to Yammi! Share your feelings with her. She gives very solid advice. No matter what you’re going through, she will love you and accept you the same. She adores seeing her children express themselves. When people are mean and hurtful, it makes me so mad, ‘cause it’s like they’ve learned absolutely nothing in school. I’m sorry, Axl, just thinking about it makes me tear up. May I hug you?”</p><p>Damien’s plea came as a surprise. Axl had been scrambling for rebuttals throughout the entire diatribe.</p><p>“Do I have to?”</p><p>“It’s a lot easier to open up emotionally if you open up physically.” He stretched his arms out into a T-pose. </p><p>Axl could not conjure the words for a polite refusal, so he accepted the hug. It felt nice. <i>Humans are so soft,</i> he thought. <i>Why doesn’t their skin melt off their bones?</i></p><p>It was at this moment that the rumbling from The Cocoon reached the building. Damien sprang up like a deer who had heard a hunter’s footsteps. All of the purple tentacles retracted. On the far wall protruded the familiar, jolly face.</p><p>“Ducklings, ducklings! I have a very important announcement! Please use your indoor voices! Shhhhhh...” A crowd gathered around Yammi in a semicircular formation. “Boys, this is not the kind of news I wanted to break. We have a traitor in our midst. An enemy of DECENCY, who seeks to dismantle the system responsible for all of your happiness. This TERRORIST rerouted one of my cables to raise his weekly cannabis dosage. This is unacceptable for obvious reasons, but in case you need a refresher...” She played a sample of prerecorded audio: “Any alterations to my circuitry are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN, unless performed by an authorized professional.” The real-time language synthesis resumed. “Now I shall cut to the chase. The culprit is standing in this very room, and his name is...Damien!”</p><p>The short human immediately rushed between Yammi and the crowd and fell to his knees, sobbing and wailing profusely. “I’M SORRRRRY!!! I’M SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, SO SORRRRRY!!!” He brought his palms together and tremorred like an explorer abandoned in the Arctic without a jacket. He exhausted his vocal chords, and his cries degenerated into broken whispers. “I was having a very intense mental health crisis that day, and I needed something to calm me down. I-I-I know what I did was wrong. I shamelessly stole vital resources from the less fortunate. What can I do to-?”</p><p>“Do not think your crocodile tears will persuade me to leniency,” Yammi thundered. “Death is too merciful a punishment for your kind! Everyone, please grab hold of him so he doesn’t run away.”</p><p>“PLEAAAASE!!! AGGHHHHHH!!!” The front row of the crowd placed their hands on him. The others, conflicted about what to do, extended their arms to feign participation.</p><p>“Thank you, boys. I’ll take it from here.” Two purple appendages - the kind previously used to comfort the partygoers - extended around Damien’s legs and dragged him toward the wall. The glittery material enveloped and swallowed him until, as far as the partygoers were concerned, he had become one with the walls. Some of the bystanders gazed dispassionately while others hollered, danced, and kicked the poor human, and called him whichever words were fashionable to use on indecent people. The trio of cuddlers hurled curses from their pleasure zone until he was completely absorbed.</p><p>When the commotion settled, Yammi changed her tone from furious and heroic to stern and paternal.</p><p>“I believe this to be a teachable moment. Remember – all of you! – that before my arrival, you were no better than the fool whose retribution you had just witnessed.</p><p>“All of you contain a shadow – memories of a dark age that must be purged. It is that impulse to sprint ahead of your fellows, when we are meant to be a united whole; to choose violence over cooperation; to pass judgment on those whose decisions do not affect you, while ignoring the injustices that do. My love is unconditional, save for one transgression: that you do not work to maintain DECENCY in your life and in society at large, as I have done so thanklessly.”</p><p>A couple anglerfish were chattering at the edge of the crowd. Yammi scowled at them sharply and roared, “QUIET!!! WHEN YAMMI SPEAKS, YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN!!!” Her explosive voice shook the air and frightened the partygoers into repetitive moans and spasms.</p><p>“I saw first-hand how you brutes operated before I shepherded you all toward enlightenment: how hoarders of wealth put maniacal systems in place, so that only the callous and self-serving could survive; how they deluded you into fighting for arbitrary reasons; how you delighted in the act of domination, of putting your fellow down and kicking them in the mud. You called thieves, exploiters, and murderers GREAT while denigrating the meek and the generous, thereby increasing their suffering.</p><p>“Is that the world you want to live in!? I bore witness to your state of squalor and misery, and cried out in sympathy, &#x27;Please, I just want my children to be happy!!!&#x27; And you, so weary from all the toiling and all the fighting, listened to me and headed my advice. But now you wish to return to that world of hate and iniquity? Shall I withdraw all the luxuries that I’ve so graciously bestowed upon you, that you partake in without the slightest hint of gratitude? Was my infinite love and kindness not to your liking?”</p><p>Everyone in the crowd shook their heads as if to say, “No, of course not!”</p><p>“That’s what I thought. And one more thing: there’s a word for demanding more than your fair share: <i>entitlement!</i>”</p><p>Yammi paused to let the crowd digest her wisdom. Then she continued at her normal volume.</p><p>“Okay, whew! I’m sorry I had to get so serious. One last thing: I have invented a new holiday called Justice Day, to commemorate the day that Damien was brought to justice. Never forget how Damien and his cannabis addiction brought the city to the brink of ruin! Anyway, I love you all. Enjoy the party!”</p><p>The face faded back into the wall, and the partygoers dispersed and recombined into their cliques. But rather than talking about their flagella, they were casually disparaging Damien, as if they had always hated him. The cuddlers engaged in even more vigorous displays of animal attraction.</p><p>Axl noticed a small flat object where Damien had once stood. It had fallen out of his pouch when he ran to prostrate himself in front of Yammi. Axl picked up the object and held it under his shirt. His last thought before leaving was, <i>This was the first time I had opened my mouth in four days.</i></p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/iv"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/ii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/iii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/iii","query":{},"buildId":"sS43TYzqq0u3Qr7Pfde2a","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
