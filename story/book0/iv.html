He was bitter because he had been the object of pity. He was like a stray dog or a child without an education – something for strangers to gawk at and shout “awww!” to their friends. The humiliation stung deep in his chest. <i>I would much rather be hated than pitied.</i> That is what he told himself, for he was rarely the object of hatred.</p><p>Moreover, his single claim to superiority - his moral superiority - had been exposed as fraudulent. He could no longer say, “I may not have friends, but at least I’m not so and so,” nor could he say, “All of my problems would be solved, if only someone were kind enough to help me.” His excuses had run out.</p><p>Axl inspected the object left by Damien. It was a stack of papers glued together, each leaf covered in rows of multisyllabic words and esoteric symbols. The cover read, Agenda 4000. He scanned a couple pages at random. “Self-simulation...limitless self expression...energy fields...destructive interference...into the subject’s true self.” Axl could understand none of these hieroglyphics, but he recognized the phrase “true self,” which Damien had uttered during their conversation.</p><p>What was Axl’s true self? He looked inward and found no distinguishing qualities and nothing to express to the world. No vector through which to introduce himself to others. No one could say of Axl, “I like him because...” Of course, his current self was not his true self. He thought about the self he wanted to be, and similarly found no traits in particular. He just wanted friends. He wanted to be liked. He didn’t want to be a loser anymore.</p><p>Then Axl envisioned his future. He would die alone in his bed, the humiliation of this day having gripped his chest until his last breath. He would die never having experienced the pleasures endemic to a full life: love, companionship, laughter, and belonging. No playful banter, no running gags, no pleasure time, no cuddling, no moments of vulnerability, and no outpourings of gratitude. He would die having been less-than-nothing. All this despite Yammi and Damien’s love and support, and their genuine pleas for action. </p><p>Axl’s existence did not constitute a life per se. There was no story, no memories, no wisdom to take to the afterlife. It was a nebulous, claustrophobic blur of experience that felt everlasting from the inside but  left absolutely zero impression on the universe at large. Like a bubble on the ocean surface, though the use of a natural metaphor would lend it too much credit. Axl’s continuance involved meandering from place to place, either subtracting value from his vicinity or leaving no trace. He would have nothing of interest to observe from the heavens post-expiration.</p><p>At the height of his loneliness, Axl would become convinced that there existed only two beings in the universe: himself, and the Mad God who subjected him to the torture of the perceptual world. His vision would narrow and turn inward, and recede into the skull. The ugly sights and molesting sounds would become a pair of irremovable goggles, or a screen from which he could not pull back; and the impression that <i>This is all there is</i> would pull his soul irresistibly downward, toward idleness, toward the swamp-bed.</p><p>Axl looked out the nearest window and tried to distract himself with the view. He could not discern any of the buildings below because the one he was in cast a brooding shadow over it all. It was one of many Villages – vast, rectangular arcologies of compressed and petrified fungal material, which stood domineering and stately over the rest of the city. Every brick laid in Yammi’s Radiant City was imperfect in its own way. Brittle, irregular, and rife with pores, a strong blow could knock one from its place. Indeed, every wall had a hole that let the sickening wind in. Loose cables, leakage, and haphazard plastering jobs abounded. Buildings sloped by a few stories along their axes. Without continual maintenance, the fungi would return to their natural forms, and the complexes would melt into mile-long mud palaces.</p><p>Yammi’s city was very walkable. The Villages were connected by steel sky bridges left over from construction, which flew high over the various barrios and Aquatic Zones where finned creatures could swim. The maze of bridges, canals, hallways, and lobbies were how people got around. The aimless wanderer might spot a few lone concrete beams, hinting at a long-abandoned infrastructure project.</p><p>A strange infestation had also afflicted the city. Corals and anemones grew upwards from the Aquatic Zones, through the stacked metal shacks, and up to the megaliths, cracking concrete and serverring wires on their way. Axl dreaded when the hallways were too narrow, because he imagined the growths poisoning him as he brushed past. He also feared the day when the corals would bore through the walls of his Private Space, exposing himself to his neighbors.</p><p>The city was a location out of space. One could not speak of it in relation to some outside world. It was as much a fixture of experience as the sky or the ground. Only one landmark in the city bore any significance beyond the binary “safe to go” and “not safe to go.” That was The Cocoon - the seat of Yammi’s protection from which her love would overflow onto the city’s inhabitants.</p><p>Axl walked halfway to his Private Space before his stubby legs began to ache, so he sat down in the corner of a lounge area. The room sported a moldy ball pit and a colorful mural on the far wall, showing creatures of all types and proportions holding hands in solidarity for an unknown cause. The chairs did not have spaces between the back and bottom cushions, through which Axl could fit his tale. Axl curled up and shifted around so as not to slip, but to no avail. The frustration rose up like pressurized gas and freed itself through effeminate grunts.</p><p>Across the room were two sharks who, judging by their tipsiness, had also left from the party. Their only discernible features were their muscles - engorged, discolored, balloon-like, unindicative of actual strength, covered with blemishes and lumps and other artifacts from successive Changes.</p><p>“I wanna try something different tonight,” said the first shark.</p><p>“How about...a shark!” exclaimed the second.</p><p>“I already am one, dumbass,” and they both giggled deliriously.</p><p>“How about...a dragon!”</p><p>The first shark replied to the second’s proposition, “Ooo, that’s very sexy. But what color? Red? Blue?”</p><p>“Bright colors just look goofy.” The second shark thought for a moment and gasped, “Metallic! You should have metallic scales!”</p><p>“That’s genius! That’s some four-twenty IQ shit right there, hehehe. Okay, Yammi, I feel like a metallic dragon tonight.”</p><p>Yammi responded, “Sweetie, that Change will take at least a couple days.”</p><p>“No, I want it now! I’m really feeling like a fuckin’ dragon tonight!”</p><p>“An eight foot tall dragon. And make the pecs huge. Like really huge.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>From a shark to a dragon - not an unconventional transformation. In a single month, Axl had witnessed: a whale so vast that he did not fit in the hallways, an adult in the body of a pre-pubescent seahorse; a dragon covered from head to toe in hairy flagella; two partners occupying a single human body with two faces, where one face was located on the crotch; and a swordfish whose bill was so sharp that he stabbed three to death in a fit of annoyance. One usually asked Yammi to enlarge whichever body parts would be most exciting to look at during a ritual of friendship.</p><p>A ceiling panel opened and a laser pointer, no larger than a whiteboard marker, greeted the impatient shark.</p><p>“Ah, on second thought, having a big snout makes it hard to brush your teeth. You can’t reach up–.”</p><p>The shark’s maw opened wide and released the hellish wail of an air raid siren. His skin bubbled and folded and necrosed. His previously immaculate physique bulged and contracted. He struggled off the chair and fell to the ground, but the laser rotated accordingly. Yammi reshaped his bones and rearranged his ventricles so that he resembled a collapsed tent. His wails turned into gargles as the passage from his lungs to his mouth was not maintained. Yammi managed to sculpt half a wing and a few patches of golden scales before halting the process. The shark had mutated into a bag of bones in the literal sense.</p><p>“Oh fuck! Yammi, bring him back!” cried the still-intact shark, hands pressed against the sides of his head. “Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you! Help me fix my friend!” But Axl was already gone.</p><p>Axl’s snout was also so long and his arms so short that it made daily tasks a burden. He ate directly from the plate like pigs from a trough, and when the shower did not produce hot water, he washed his face by placing a wet towel on a surface and rubbing his head against it. Damien was right: maybe he should try a new body.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/v"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/iii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/iv#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/iv","query":{},"buildId":"VTrip7zn8hxOGZ8uOyB00","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
