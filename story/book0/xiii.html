Finn took Axl back to the treehouse. They bathed and tended to their cuts, scrapes, and burns. Then Finn showed Axl a room previously unseen - a circular sanctuary lit by dim candlelight and lined on all sides by shrines and sacred objects.</p><p>He gave Axl the tour. “You have already seen my lucky sword, with whom I slay my enemies. Look: here is my lucky flute, with whom I perform lovely incantations, and imbue the world with wonderful melodies; here is the rack where I place my lucky scarf; and...”</p><p>“What’s that in the middle?” asked Axl.</p><p>“Tee-hee, let me show you!”</p><p>In the center of the room was a flat pan made from the most vibrant, azure-colored agate crystals, filled to the brim with fine white sand and replete with complex grains and strata reminiscent of the tempests on Jupiter’s surface. Finn snuffed out the candles so that both he and Axl were shrouded in darkness. He focused his psychic energy on the pan and blew a few notes on his flute, causing the sand to erupt into brilliant green flame. The combustion expanded outward, and in its wake the full effulgence of daylight beamed forth. The sand had hidden a great expanse of sky.</p><p>“Here is my portal, my gateway to the Great City,” said Finn. “I can view anything from here, but I hope to never need it in the future. Tell me if you recognize this place.”</p><p>The clouds in the pan shifted and the skies turned an ominous red. When Axl peered in, he perceived only a plain surface of rough ash. But he strained his tiny beads, and found flashes of color amongst the dullness - green. In the center of the pan jutted a single brown mote - The Cocoon!</p><p>“That’s where I came from.”</p><p>Finn could hardly contain his excitement. “Look at how tiny your home is. I could set down a single claw and millions of your kind would perish. How does it feel that I am holding your world hostage?”</p><p>Axl did not respond. He was completely bewitched by the blinking colors and circuitry on the pan, like a baby watching television. </p><p>“Oh Axl,” muttered the creature, “you jump at the sound of a cracking branch, but my threats go ignored. I’m not a puppy! I’m not a teddy bear! I have claws that can cut stone, and my sorcery will collapse your brain in an instant! Why does no one recoil at my appearance when they know I can kill them?”</p><p>Axl looked up and found Finn downcast and dejected, and he remembered his life back home: that the mere sight of an oncoming pedestrian would cause him to fall to pieces; that he longed for the moment when the situation would be reversed. Thus Axl sympathized with a living creature for the first time, and not a faceless category like “humanity” or “the less fortunate.” Beyond the anxiety of having to remedy Finn’s injury lay a quiet euphoria. </p><p>“I thought you were scary when you fought that monster,” said Axl. “And your teeth and your claws are scary, too. You’re scarier than the thing that bit my arm off.”</p><p>Finn’s eyes widened to monopolize his entire face. “Really, Axl? You think so?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m scared of you. You’re, like, a <i>viscous</i> predator!”</p><p>He flared his nostrils and showed the most exuberant and toothy grin yet. “Oh, thank you, thank you! The word you wanted was ‘vicious,’ but you are so kind. You’ve brightened my day, Axl. I could hug you this instant!”</p><p>“I like hugs!” cried Axl.</p><p>Finn scampered over and buried his face in Axl’s torso, and crushed it with his arms, so that Axl almost fell forward. His body was hot like a fireplace, and he smelled like fresh air. His fur was so fine and weightless that it tickled like the mists of morning. Meanwhile, Axl’s torso felt to Finn like a firm but comfy mattress. Their bodies stayed wedded for a long time. Axl could hear Finn mutter under his breath, “He’s being truthful as well.”</p><p>After admiring the dreadful grayness inside Finn’s portal, which covered the whole world like a coat of dust, the two left and went into the living room. Finn brought tea for both of them, and they sat down across from each other.</p><p>“Tell me, Axl, do you want to return to your computer mommy? I can send you back immediately.”</p><p>Axl dreaded this question. He figured that his time in this world was nearing its end, but emboldened by the lovely exchange that had just taken place, he stated his case:</p><p>“I don’t wanna sleep in my bed anymore. Your couch is much more cozy. I don’t wanna look at my home anymore. Everything is so dark. The colors make me sick, and it smells terrible. But the Woods is the opposite: when I find something cool, I don’t wanna take my eyes off it. The people back home were...intimidating? Every question feels like a challenge. They cackle at me, and their faces are bright and ugly, so I have to turn away. But I love everyone here. Even when I want to run away from them, they keep talking to me. And...” </p><p>Another realization invaded Axl’s mind, and his whole body tremored. <i>Was Yammi still listening?</i> He compressed his lips and scoured the room with his eyes, but no amount of surveyance could convince him that it hid no recording equipment. And yet, Finn’s patient gaze compelled him to continue.</p><p>He revealed with a burst of energy, “I hate Yammi! She’s mean and nasty, and only knows how to say, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that.’ She tells me how great I am in one sentence, and berates me in the next. And she gives us nothing to do. When I saw you and Floppa fight that monster...I don’t know how to feel about that. Why did you have to kill him?”</p><p>“Because otherwise he would have eaten you for supper!” Finn exclaimed.</p><p>“I know,” said Axl. “I just wish you didn’t kill him. But either way, when you swooshed that giant knife around, I thought, <i>Wow, I wanna do that, too!</i> If Yammi gave me a giant knife, I would be so much more confident. But she only gives us food and weed.”</p><p>Finn sat back and raised his hand to his chin. “You make an impregnable argument, lizard. I wouldn’t want to spend a minute in that dump you call a home. But you also do not belong here. Oh, I suppose it’s time to tell the truth. The people of Stillwater are a polite bunch, but they want you out. They think that you’re a vagrant with some kind of brain damage, and they’re not equipped to deal with you. Don’t be offended, Mister Lizard. I just wanted you to enjoy your stay here.”</p><p>It took several seconds for Axl to process this information. “So they’re not my friends?” he stammered.</p><p>“No.”</p><p><i>They want me out.</i> Those words flooded Axl’s mind like the ocean that rips through the humble seaside town. The interlinking complexes of Axl’s psyche reemerged ten times as caustic to the soul as all of his progress was revealed to be illusory. He wanted to curl up silent on Finn’s couch until he faded into a ghost. Was there ever a point in opening his mouth? Fate had clearly decided that Axl would be born a substance distinct from the rest of the living world, that all of his thoughts and desires would be incommunicable, and any connection impossible. He was an anomaly of noninteracting matter so remote that no conceivable universe could house him properly.</p><p>Finn continued, “Everyone will be very cross with me if I keep you any longer. But maybe...” He sighed pensively and stared at the ceiling for a while. Then he pulled his ears over his eyes and started kicking like a rabbit, crying, “Oh, I’m being so silly! I’ll only get myself killed if I...”</p><p>“If you what?” said Axl.</p><p>“If I bring you with me, and leave Floppa to fend for the Woods!”</p><p>“I want to come!”</p><p>“You don’t know what you ask for, lizard.” Finn paused again in deep contemplation, and then announced, “I need to share my thoughts.” Axl sat straight with full attention as he spoke.</p><p>“Hear the ultimate wisdom of the magician: that the universe in its natural state is a sea of boiling excrement. At least nine hundred and ninety-nine souls in a thousand wallow Down Below - that sewer! The world down there is like music composed only with low notes and dull timbers. And the ants, the bottom-feeders, the destroyers who emerge from that thick froth...they float and splash around, and fuck loudly (excuse my language), and torture the helpless, and drown their friends out of boredom, and do other unremarkable things, feeling neither joy nor misery. They cannot see five feet in front of themselves, for it is at the peaks and troughs of life that the world is revealed to the magician. As soon as their tenures of life expire, they resubmerge into the filth as if they had never existed. But alas, the sewer persists! They are less-than-nothing! They are waste! Oh, I hate them! I mean...I love everyone, but not those folks in particular.”</p><p>Axl understood what Finn was talking about, or at least he thought so. <i>Brash, braindead animals.</i></p><p>Finn continued. “A few blessed individuals, however, capture more refined frequencies. They live in agony, suffocated by the sewer’s nose-stinging stench. They thrash about wildly, not knowing where to direct their energy. The liquid death inhibits them, and it reassures them, ‘You’ve exerted yourself quite enough, my fabulous gems. Relax your arms and legs, and you may rest with the other geniuses.’ They are thus reabsorbed by their own self-absorption, yet believe that they have escaped. Once in a millennium, however, a soul or two may miraculously rise from the sewer like a soap bubble.</p><p>“Once the critical threshold of enlightenment is crossed - ah! - the entire orchestra can be heard in its resounding warmth and fullness. The radius of darkness pulls back, revealing green trees and vast yellow sunrises. Whereas before you sucked regurgitant from your neighbor’ mouths, you can now eat fresh meats with exotic herbs and spices - like a king!” Finn’s mouth started to water. He poked his little pink tongue out and licked his lips.</p><p>“Contempt sheds off the body like snakeskin, and the scum-bathers whom you detested with blind passion are now beheld with a sharp eye. The swamp turns out to be a mere puddle. It is true! - I can bend over my portal and with a single breath your home would be reduced to rubble. Tee-hee, I get giddy just thinking about it. But I refrain, for I am a benevolent god!”</p><p>Axl inferred that he was a soap bubble, but as far as he knew, he did not undergo any kind of enlightenment, nor was his escape from the Down Below a struggle. His journey thus far had mostly been a series of accidents. Fearful of being sent home, he kept his mouth shut.</p><p>“The enlightened individual,” Finn said, “having ascended a single plane, will usually settle into his princely garden of many enclosures, and think, <i>I have all I need to carry me through life.</i> But a few of us want to tear the hedges down. I love my Woods dearly, Axl - the sun rays that shine through the canopy, the damp moss on the tree trunks, the birds who sing in celestial prophecies - but the people here are not my kin. They are peasants: harmless folk! They live by their cute aphorisms and show the proper reverence for pretty things, but their minds are simple and their hearts lukewarm. We are nothing alike, and I can’t talk to birds any longer, so I have an ulterior motive in leaving the Woods. My true ambition is no less than world domination!”</p><p>Domination - Axl remembered that word. It meant, To kick someone in the mud. He stammered, “W-world domination?”</p><p>“Yes!” Finn said. “There is a restlessness inside me, Axl. It is the will to expand, to express oneself, to spread oneself around like a dog peeing on the bushes.” He chuckled, thinking of Walter. “It is the spirit that animates both the artist and the conqueror; the creativity by which the cosmos itself was fashioned. I have so much to give to the world, Axl.</p><p>“Remember what I said about the peaks and troughs. When the lungs of the world are full or empty, that is when the magic happens. With each successive frequency attained, I am brought closer to the divine. Once I breach the Up Above, my infinite variations shall spill over so that the land is awash in me. Every tree and rock shall bear my mark. With a single thought, I shall rearrange the stars, and mountains shall crumble into dust. I’ll marry the Earth Herself (I wonder what our babies will look like!), at which point my conquest will continue ever outward.</p><p>“Oh! - perhaps my future self is already looking down upon me, encouraging me from the heavens or from the lit fireplace, or from the fly on the wall. But before any of this, I’ll find who’s responsible for the degradation of my Woods and bring the might of all Death’s galloping armies down upon his throat, and the whole world will know that Finn is violent, that Finn is vengeful! Keep glutting yourselves on feces, slugs! Your slum, your trash river, your backwater, your swamp which-in all great things soon sink - these I shall destroy! And to the bottom-feeders who treat the gift of life so carelessly - you can die for all I care! And the ones who live will bend the knee under my imperishable reign of terror! And...oh, that’s it I guess.”</p><p>As Finn said this, he made stomping motions with his feet. His chest thumped and radiated warmth. </p><p>Axl asked, now more agitated, “B-but what if people don’t like that?”</p><p>“Don’t like what?”</p><p>“You re-raging the stars.”</p><p>“A lot of people will try to stop me. I-”</p><p>“No! I mean afterwards. After you already dominated the world.”</p><p>“Then I’ll have only other gods to worry about.”</p><p>“But what if the stars want to be left alone? You shouldn’t move them if they don’t want to be moved.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because they just want to be happy like everyone else! And you’re prolly gonna kill more people. What you’re doing is mean and selfish. I thought you were a decent person, but you’re really like the humans who killed my, uh...”</p><p>“Ancestors.”</p><p>“Yeah, those.”</p><p>Axl imagined Finn gobbling the young salamanders from the lakes of Mexico, his sharp teeth piercing their poor bellies, and he wept again. Now there was truly no one in this world whom he could trust.</p><p>Finn scooted next to Axl, placed his paw on his knee, and tried to console him. “Please don’t cry, Mister Lizard,” he said. “I won’t go out of my way to hurt anyone. I love the stars and the mountains and the Earth, and I especially love axolotls. I shall be their protector.”</p><p>Axl turned to the creature, who was giving puppy eyes, and said, “What do they need your mark for?”</p><p>“Axl, I...” Finn didn’t want to state the truth straight away, which was that they didn’t need his mark in any rational sense. “This is what I ought to do with my life. It will be a beautiful thing.”</p><p>“When I love something,” Axl cried, “I don’t wanna touch it or mess with it. I want it to be itself. It doesn’t even have to know about me.”</p><p>Finn giggled, “Is that how you think about women?” and he held Axl’s hand. “How about this: I shall ask first before moving any stars around. I won’t be a tyrant. Does that sound fair to you?”</p><p>With a few long, stuttered breaths, Axl regained his composure somewhat, and murmured, “Mmm-hmm.”</p><p>“Do you still want to go with me?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’m just a dumb lizard who’s scared of everything. I’ll prolly die in a stupid way, like falling off a ledge. I won’t even get to hold a knife.”</p><p>“Don’t say that!” Finn grabbed Axl’s hand tighter, so that his claws dug in. “How splendid would it be for a Blueblood to be a hero! Axl the Last Axolotl, who saved The Forests - that is how a thousand generations will remember you!”</p><p>“Why do you want me to come so badly? And please let me go. You’re hurting me.”</p><p>“Oh, sorry.” He relinquished Axl’s hand, leaving four little notches. “You make me laugh - that is why. Now I may ask the same of you: what about adventure and about brushing against Death appeals to you?”</p><p>The lust for danger had taken root in Axl’s heart, but that was not his primary motivator. <i>I want to follow Finn around, to see him do more magic tricks, to listen to him talk about the world, for him to give me stuff to do, he thought. He let me stay in his village, and now he’ll show me even more cool stuff. I want to hug him again. That felt so nice!</i></p><p>Finally, he answered, “You make me feel safe - that’s why.”</p><p>“Don’t take my protection for granted!” Finn exclaimed. “This is an expedition into the dangerous unknown. Death will stalk us behind every tree and boulder, ready to take either of us out.”</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>The reality of Axl’s inexperience suddenly dawned on Finn and blasted away his confidence. But he was determined to squeeze any vitality he could from the vulnerable salamander, for he also wanted to be with him.</p><p>“Tell me, Axl,” he said, “have you ever felt miserable? I’m not referring to your momentary crying fits. I mean truly miserable.”</p><p>Axl was too embarrassed to recount the many nights when, overcome by hopelessness and isolation, he cried himself to sleep; that even his happiest moments would be shrouded in a fog of anhedonia.</p><p>Finn reiterated: “Have you ever, in a lucid state of mind and fully comprehending the finality of Death, felt compelled to grab the nearest sharp object and with total conviction ram it into your throat?”</p><p>“No.” Axl never seriously contemplated suicide. Perhaps that was because Axl, even in his most frustrated state, never crossed the margin of acceptance, at which point the depressed individual sees no other way to live and ascribes with absolute certainty a negative value to existence.</p><p>“Then you do not know misery,” Finn said. “Perhaps you have thought, <i>I am sad today,</i> and shed a few tears, but you do not know misery. Nor do you know that most sublime weightlessness and vitality of having brought about the total annihilation of your enemies. Nor have you felt such explosive hatred that your body would later be painted in the blood of innocent passersby. I would add collapsing from exhaustion to this list, but that is apparently the only exception.</p><p>“If you follow me, then you will know these extremes. You’ll know the life of the Hero, who takes the acute pain of tragedy over the dull overcastness of disappointment. Most people prefer their lives to look like rolling hills instead of mountains. Peasants with foothill lives love to scoff, ‘See the Hero on his frivolous escapades, wandering aimless without a center, without an attractor, without roots to tie him down. Does he think he is immortal? What is power and glory compared to peace, the company of family, and other niceties?’ Then, in the next breath, they proclaim, ‘I’m a hero for waking up in the morning, for following my quaint little routines, for worshiping my idols, for getting my wife to sleep with me, for being well liked by my neighbors, and for doing my part.’ The Hero isn’t anyone’s husband or neighbor, and he’s not satisfied doing his part; he takes more than his fair share.</p><p>“And in order to truly take rather than to beg, you must gleefully accept hardship so intolerable that no mortal can prepare himself. No more crying! Be sturdy as the lone rock battered by whitecaps. Eschew the tender hand that softens the heart, and plunge headlong into the ice bath. If riled by the passions, let them shout clearly and decisively: ‘For every friend that dies, so too will a hundred enemies.’ And most importantly, <i>be prepared to die!</i> There is no Axl to be preserved; only your mission, which is of a nobler and more perennial nature.</p><p>“Do you understand the severity of this decision, to live the simple, half-full life or the life of extremes? When the Heavens and the Earth conspire against you, when you are more parched than a man with rabies, when your foe appears radiant and immortal and indestructible and yourself so naked and insignificant, will you still pick up your blade and by your pinky toe go in for that fateful lunge?”</p><p>Finn’s warning called all of Axl’s initial enthusiasm into question. He didn’t want to die, but a lifetime of loneliness, fear, and lethargy, existing as backdrop to the stories of his brilliant and self-assured peers, constituted a slow death unto itself. Finn was his only escape from that murky trench of, not half-fullness, but less-than-nothing. And despite the perils that Finn had foretold, Axl still assured himself that he would be okay, as long as the fluffy creature stood by his side.</p><p>“I still wanna go,” he said, this time more confident than ever. “I won’t cry anymore. If I do, then you can scratch me on my hip!”</p><p>“Would you rather die than go back home?”</p><p>He jumped out of his seat, overflowing with energy. “Yes, yes! I’ll die if it means staying with you!”</p><p>Finn brought Axl back down to Earth. “All right,” he said calmly. “I’ve made my decision. You’ll be my lackey once again.”</p><p>Axl showered Finn in thanks and praise, so ecstatic that he couldn’t keep still. But when the elation wore off, he had one last thing to get off his chest. “Finn,” he said, having reverted to his usual timidness, “there’s another reason why I don’t wanna go home. It’s because I...” He paused, knowing how infantile the words that were to come from his mouth would sound. “It’s because I don’t have any friends. Well, one, but-”</p><p>“I’ll be your friend!” Finn shouted. “I’ll never leave your side! We’ll be best friends!” But as soon as he said this, he recanted: “No, I take it all back! You ought to learn self-sufficiency. The Hero is the agent, immovable, undesiring! He stands on his own two feet! Friendship is another anchor to the sewer! Is there a greater sin than to give yourself over to another person? Umm...ah, I think we both need assistance on this front, so...I’ll be your friend for now, I guess.”</p><p>Axl was tempted to bombard Finn with even greater praise, but found it redundant. The two hugged again, even longer and tighter this time. Axl perched his chin atop Finn’s head and closed his eyes. </p><p>But Finn relinquished the salamander all too soon, and pronounced, “Enough talk, enough philosophizing, enough waxing poetic, enough explanation, enough words, opinions, ideas...tomorrow we fling ourselves onto the Frontier! Forget everything you ever knew, my wonderful lizard friend!”</p><p>They left the next morning without saying goodbye to anyone.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/an"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xiii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/xiii","query":{},"buildId":"SLn6KIEZ865Ic6NHoqnTI","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
