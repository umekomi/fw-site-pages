He would first help Finn around the treehouse and then do odd jobs and errands around the village. Asking strangers for work posed a greater challenge to Axl than the work itself. He continued to hide behind corners and bushes, waiting for the optimal time to approach. A single curt rejection would briefly convince him never to show his face in the village again. However, he could not tell Finn that he had spent the day wandering like a bum. Eventually, he would find something to do, whether it was repainting a wall, tending to a garden, or cutting wood. He was terrible at every job he took up, especially with his missing arm, and he was often stopped midway, handed a few coins, and politely told to leave.</p><p>The townspeople began to question the nature of Axl’s presence. Was he a traveler low on funds? Was he a hired servant? Or did Finn really kidnap a complete stranger and force him by threat of magic to do his bidding? Several villagers knocked on Finn’s door and demanded an explanation, but they were merely assured that the pink bald one would leave shortly. In reality, Finn had no intention of expelling Axl from the Woods, back to his dark and miserable sphere.</p><p>Axl was oblivious to all of the gossip and suspicion. He enjoyed the general politeness of the villagers, however performative, and he discovered that being useful was the perfect avenue to make their acquaintance. His conversations were brief and superficial, mostly taking the form of command and response, but that did not matter. He was talking with strangers and asking questions with minimal embarrassment. He even apologized to Kirby the goat pharmacist. However out-of-place Axl felt among the Carpet Skins, their rustic charms put him at ease. They were not loud and crude like his neighbors back home. Their voices were tempered and soft on the ears, and their smiles were warm, if not a little patronizing. Their adorable faces softened Axl’s heart. He desperately wanted to stroke their fur and pull on their tails.</p><p>When Axl and Finn visited Floppa’s tavern in the quiet evening, that was when Axl could truly let loose. He spoke uninhibited and childlike about his routines, about the sights and sounds of the city, and about his computer caretaker. Finn would listen dutifully, asking for more details every time Axl finished. Even Floppa could not help but show interest in the salamander’s quaint yammerings, but he was in agreement with the village: the salamander had to go. The town was no place for shaved creatures, and it was not their responsibility to raise Axl to a functional level of competence. This dispute became the source of much bickering between the mammals, hidden from Axl’s ear.</p><p>On the fourth day, Axl’s wound began to chafe. He removed the bandage to find that a thick epidermis covered the opening. The village doctor was perplexed, and simply advised him to keep the area clean. As Axl walked out of the doctor’s office and across the square, a group of children ran up to him. They gawked and jeered and asked simple questions like “Where did you come from?” Then they galloped away, giggling to themselves. Still unaware of the turmoil between Finn and the village at large, Axl took this incident to mean that he had become a staple of the town.</p><p>Axl’s biggest accomplishment came a day later. Finn asked him to bring slices of ham from the butcher shop. Axl found the store easily, made small talk with the owner - Rudy, a hoarse and scruffy-looking boar - for three whole minutes, and returned to Finn in a punctual manner. Then Finn said something that caused Axl’s innards to melt: “Oh, thank you, thank you! You did a great job, lizard.” Axl had only been commended this way by Yammi. In fact, Yammi would shower Axl with great-jobs, but when it came from a breathing fleshy creature, the words meant so much more. These incidents were unequivocal proof that Axl belonged nowhere else but the In Between. This town was his home from a past life, and it had been his divinely ordained quest to rediscover it. What’s more, he had become an adult - nay, he now qualified as a well-adjusted “living creature.” Most importantly, he resolved the great enigma which had held him in a tangent dimension away from his peers - that of talking to people. Its simplicity embarrassed him. He needed only to surround himself with people who ask questions!</p><p>A newfound confidence and delight now permeated Axl’s every waking moment. The ambient dread and discomfort of existence had all but disappeared. With every interaction, the fear of the Other receded to the background, although he remained meek and awkward. It was because he could be meek and awkward without shame that Axl so loved his new habitat. He loved the heavenly walk to the village, the villagers themselves, and the tasks they would have him do. He loved the warmth of the day and the silence of the night and the tweeting of birds and the rustling of leaves. He would focus on the colors and textures of the In Between - the grass, the stone, the fur, the bark - but no sensation was intense enough. The next moment would wash the colors away into the dusty annals of memory. No bother! Axl could reacquire them tomorrow.</p><p>Axl also loved the taste of beer and the mammals’ jokes. He loved flopping on the couch as Finn snuffed out the candles. He loved waking up to the sound of claws clacking on hardwood. He loved the breakfasts that Finn would make for him, and the attention and the good-mornings that he would get from him. When around Finn in particular, Axl’s attention would be arrested by moments of a mystical quality, so brief that the wandering mind could not relish them. They were as simple as watching Finn wag his tail in excitement, seeing him turn around in attention, or hearing him admit to some error in judgment, but brushing it off and going about his day. Axl felt like an adventurer who had discovered the vast interior of the Hollow Earth. He had unlocked a new world of experience in merely enjoying someone’s company, and he understood why his neighbors back home seemed sheathed in an impregnable armor of confidence. They were bombarded at all times by these endearing snapshots, which filled the soul with sunlight.</p><p><i>Oh, I need more, I need more, so I can finally live like the rest of you!</i> Axl thought. He was hungrier and more exhausted in the Woods than he ever was back home, but he did not want to return.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/xii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/x"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xi#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/xi","query":{},"buildId":"Ti1KVfA8PZBjYVLMpc9G7","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
