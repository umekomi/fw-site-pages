Finn scurried out of his abode, still in his pajamas, and met with the reinsman at the front of the procession. He was old and disheveled, his gray whiskers caked in grime, and he scowled at Finn with annoyance, thinking, <i>Who is this little nuisance that obstructs my way?</i></p><p>“Mister Ferret, what are you doing in our village?” asked Finn.</p><p>“Demons!” cried the ferret. “Demons took our town. Everything is dead there, so we left.”</p><p>“To go where?”</p><p>“Anywhere, as long as it’s far away.”</p><p>“Very well. You may pass here, but please don’t make a ruckus. You’ll wake my subjects.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” murmured the ferret. He pulled his hat over his eyes and they went on their way, kicking up big dust clouds. The dispossessed families, their confused faces gleaming with dried tears, paid no attention to Finn’s coughing fit.</p><p>Later at the treehouse, Axl woke up to the sounds of frantic footsteps and the opening and closing of cabinet doors. He entered the kitchen to find Finn scouring and crawling around while Floppa stood awkwardly. It had been almost two weeks since Axl first slept in Finn’s treehouse, and the site of his wound had swollen into a bulging nub.</p><p>“What’s going on?” he asked.</p><p>“We’re going on a day trip,” Floppa replied.</p><p>“Can I come?”</p><p>“No. Ask the townspeople for something to do.”</p><p>Upon hearing Axl’s request, Finn pulled his head out of the cabinet and smiled so brightly that even his gums were visible. “Do you want to be my lackey, Axl? I’ll have a lizard as my lackey!”</p><p>“Finn, please don’t bring him.”</p><p>“I will, and you won’t stop me.”</p><p>“Why are you so infatuated with this lowlife?”</p><p>“Because he makes me laugh.”</p><p>“That’s why he should accompany a deadly mission?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The trio set off for the occupied ferret village. They rode at a moderate pace down a forest trail, which wormed beside trickling creeks and ragged stone faces. Axl sat behind Finn while Floppa rode alone. Throughout the journey, Axl would ask Finn a million questions in his usual meekness and deference, to which Finn would answer like a father does to his precocious son.</p><p>Everyone was in good spirits until they entered the vicinity of the ferret village. As they rode, the trees lost their leaves and the trunks their color. The thriving ground turned parched and the decaying remnants of the firm undergrowth blew about as tumbleweeds. The freshness of the sap-scented air gave way to an intangible stuffiness that caused the group to sniffle and their eyes to water.</p><p>The party slowed their pace. Fearful murmurs abounded until they reached the epicenter of the all-consuming degradation. The Forest abruptly ended. Before the trio lay an impassable wasteland of chalk-colored growths, sun-bleached and smelling of death, their surfaces of arrayed micro-needles sharp enough to tear the skin of a horse. Poking above the sea of ragged whiteness sat the forlorn ruins of the ferret village. All organic matter had withered away and only the stone facades of the once cozy cottages remained. Finn and Floppa stared in horror and disappointment that their work would not be easy.</p><p>Finn dismounted from his mole and ran toward the perimeter. “My Woods! They’re killing my Woods!”</p><p>“This is worse than demons,” said Floppa. “Well, there’s only one thing for it.” He fished a rusty hatchet from his bag and handed it to Axl. “Don’t cut yourself.”</p><p>The three went to work - Axl with his hatchet, Finn and Floppa with sturdier axes. None of their implements could so much as scratch the trunks. Floppa held a torch up to one of them, and its surface charred and issued from its pores gray fumes that caused the party to gag.</p><p>After much head-scratching, they elected for Finn to uproot the plants with his magic. Finn faced the blight prominently, his legs shoulder-apart and his skinny chest puffed out, and focused his mind on the dirt below the tentacles where the roots were surely hidden. But they were invisible. There was not the slightest vibration with which Finn could resonate. These plants were an anomaly as confounding as the universe itself - observable by all the typical senses but completely vacuous. No pulse, no warmth, no embers of psychic activity: an illusion? Soon Finn began to look rather ridiculous. </p><p>The always impatient Floppa moaned, “Just lift the damned thing!”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because it is lifeless.”</p><p>“You’ve moved many lifeless things.”</p><p>“Everything is alive, except for this. I hate it.”</p><p>“We don’t have time to hate.”</p><p>Finn made a second ferocious attempt, hoping for a single minute fluctuation, for one silent whisper of intelligence to grace the void. After several more minutes of searching, he found what he assumed was the incorporeal breath of life - the dynamic spirit rushing and curling atop the creative substrate of The Absolute. Through expansion of his own consciousness into this world beyond space, the learned hierophant can interact and unite with energies beyond his normal purview, and may exert seemingly nonlocal forces. He may also gain insight to the mysterious will that animates those energies, whose machinations can only be gleaned at the floor of an infinite number of infinite descents - the marriage of extremes, whereafter every iteration, recursion, power set, and diagonalization had been exhausted, and every label and definition deconstructed. Finn bound himself to that force beyond quantity, and his essence now encompassed the unthreatening blue body and the unseemly growth, or so he thought.</p><img src="/img/story/book0/field.png" style="width:50%"/><p>In attempting to levitate the growth, the incompetent salamander was raised instead, stiff and locked in place like a settled cast in an unopened mold. Floppa noticed just in time and shoved Finn to the ground. Much bickering ensued. When the flinging of tired insults ceased, the troup fell silent, feeling utterly defeated.</p><p>Then, Axl spoke up, knowing the whole time that what he had to say would be useful: “Guys? I’ve seen these before.”</p><p>“You have?” exclaimed Floppa.</p><p>“Yeah, they’re everywhere where I live. They’re corals.”</p><p>“Then surely you’d know how to get rid of them.”</p><p>“No, not really.”</p><p>Floppa flung his head back in disappointment. “Is it safe to assume that these things came from where Axl lives?”</p><p>“Deeper than that,” Finn muttered with bitterness. “These are the hands of darkness, reaching from the place so wretched that the demons of Hell avoid it like a back alley. Axl, take a look at the corals. How do they make you feel?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Axl responded. “They’re just corals.”</p><p>“Exactly!”</p><p>“We are wasting time,” Floppa interjected. “Look!” He directed Finn and Axl’s attention to the perimeter, before which tiny polyps were sprouting. The corals were advancing, and would doubtless engulf the whole Woods if left to spread unimpeded.</p><p>Luckily, another course of action sprung in Floppa’s mind. “Finn, please tell me you brought rope!” They looped a piece of rope around one of the corals and gripped its end. “No more silly parlor tricks,” Floppa proclaimed. “You can accomplish anything with a bit of muscle.”</p><p>The three tugged and tugged, falling on their backs repeatedly, until blisters appeared on their hands. Their mistake was obvious: the corals were all one organism, attached by a surface of connective tissue and a skeleton that bore deep underground. They continued pulling anyway, as that was their only option. When all seemed hopeless, the rope finally offered a little give. The subterranean guts of the coral were beginning to show, and only an extra ounce of might would uproot it completely. One final pull, and it was released from the bondage of the superorganism.</p><p>The trio enjoyed a few seconds of much deserved celebration, and they prepared to dislodge another polyp, but their troubles had only just begun. The downed coral, with its posterior folds and cavities still attached, began to writhe around, and the needled valleys on its surface rippled and coagulated into a single mouth. A few appendages shot into the ground. By sucking nutrients from the rest of the organism, the marine carcass began to grow, and was imbued with the illusion of agency.</p><p>The three were distracted, and they did not see what was forming beside them - a giant pale mass with many feet, covered in barbed tentacles and cysts, and rippled like a zen garden. It dragged behind its gurgling gastrodermal sac as it lumbered forward. When they finally noticed its presence, it opened its giant frontal cavity, exposing a hundred concentric rows of sea urchin spines, and it let out the most miserable, distressing groan, which simultaneously communicated the desire to kill and the desire to die.</p><p>As the Protector of the Woods, Finn had encountered many demons before. They haunted the most deserted recesses of the Forest, where ancient murder-suicides had taken place and spiritual energy had collected. Ghosts, chimeras, devils, and countless other kinds of abomination - each emerged from the underworld to kill, to de-energize, to desaturate, and to spread sorrow. With a few quick swipes, Finn could dispatch them easily. The intelligent ones were never courageous, always pleading for pity and leniency when death seemed imminent. One would say: “Leave us be! This Woods is not your garden to manicure.” And another: “You are no steward to Nature. You’re a destroyer, just like the rest of us!” And a third: “What you are doing here is aberrant! This world is not for little men to conquer, you tiny speck in the continuum!” And a fourth: “At least let us ravage this Woods so that new growth may rejuvenate it!” Finn would rarely dignify them with a response, but in his mind would say, <i>You have trampled my flowers, gnawed at my trees, slain my birds and squirrels, dumped your waste into my rivers, and turned everything gray and rotten. There is no question here of who is righteous and who is evil. Now good shall prevail again!</i> whereupon he would remorselessly shear the enemy’s head off like one of the village&#x27;s sacrifices.</p><p>He unsheathed his lucky sword and assumed a fighting stance. Floppa too had been embroiled in a few tussles with demons, and with ax in hand, he got into the swinging position. Axl was obviously the odd one out, and he stood behind in befuddlement, having lost the plot.</p><p>Seeing as magic was unavailable to Finn, he entered a cycle of hacking at the behemoth and retreating to a safe distance. Floppa followed suit. But as before, their weapons ricocheted off the beast’s hard exterior. The monster charged incessantly and spit green acid from its repulsive mouth. The constant diving and maneuvering prevented the mammals from coordinating. They led it into the Woods, where there was sufficient cover. Liquid death leaked from the beast’s behind and melted the grass and flowers. It carelessly rammed into the brittle trunks and propelled flurries of splinters at the party, but was not phased in the slightest.</p><p>The scrambling and brandishing of blades began to exhaust the trio. Their feet burned on the corrosive mucus, and stray droplets shore off tufts of fur and sheets of epidermis. They huffed like dogs in the summertime and stumbled gracelessly like old men. The beast, however, possessed infinite energy, never slipping nor failing to face its prey head-on before a charge, and always leaving small lacerations with its poisonous needles. It was fearless; no jolting forward nor pointing of blades could compel it backward.</p><p>Finn figured that if he could not use magic on the beast directly, then he could take control of other objects in the Woods. But first, he needed to pull back, which would put his partners in danger. He led his foe further inward to a ridge which he assumed was too steep to climb. Indeed, the ground slipped below the monster’s feet, and it could not make the ascent. Floppa joined Finn on the high ground and began hacking once more. Finn then stepped away and allowed his heart to settle, and let the pain and irritation on his body fade like a mirage.</p><p>But just as Finn attained a state of sufficient focus, the beast caught onto his trick and found a way around the incline. Floppa narrowly avoided its swift bite by scampering on all fours. Using whatever psychic energy he could muster, Finn attempted to block the beast’s path with stray logs, but it broke through them effortlessly. Much dismayed at the injury he was inflicting on the Woods, he uprooted some trees whose roots had mostly withered, and allowed them to topple onto the beast. They were shrugged off without so much as a pause.</p><p>Then Axl, whose job so far had been to run away, had a surprisingly observant thought: that they should stop hacking at the beast’s front and sides, but aim for the fleshy stomach at the back. He relayed his theory from afar, and the plan was set. One mammal would distract the beast from the front, while the other hacked from behind. But the matter of which mammal would assume which role had not been resolved. Even when Death was charging straight at them, they still found time to argue. In the time it would have taken to slay the beast, it caught sight of the pink figure hiding in the faraway shrubbery, and gave chase.</p><p>Axl was not even a quarter as fast as the galloping behemoth. He jogged like a little girl, hand up to his chest, and he tripped on every branch and stone. Between the beast and the salamander rested the two moles that were the trio’s rides. They had only a second to scamper away before they were shredded to pieces. The trio’s belongings were similarly devoured or scattered in random directions.</p><p>With all their stamina, the Carpet Skins scurried up to the behemoth’s backside, singing off the final layers of skin from their paws. Moments before Axl would have succumbed to its array of heinous spikes, the pair dove forward and with their weapons punctured the abomination’s stomach, releasing a torrent of white gore and hot acid. The beast collapsed and groaned sorrowfully, but it was not yet dead. Axl rolled away, and its cavity, still seeking nothing but its own satiation, now faced nobody. It was open to a final attack.</p><p>Finn skirted the border of consciousness as his magical antics had depleted his energy, but he volunteered anyway. He levitated the ash-colored remains of a fallen tree and plunged it dead-center into the beast’s tunnel of death. A pitiful shriek resounded in the Woods and fountains of pernicious fluid burst from every ripple on the beast’s exterior. Its organs exploded from a sudden release of pressure, and vomit spilled from its deflated opening. It rested in a toxic pool, a hideous stain on the Woods that would hopefully decompose as soon as possible.</p><p>Finn caught himself just before fainting. The trio got up, exchanged a few are-you-okays, and rested for a while, thankful that their injuries were minor. Then the mammals realized what had become of the moles.</p><p>“Why did you let it get away?” Floppa said with rancor.</p><p>“You were right in front of it!” Finn retorted. “I was trying to move behind like we planned.”</p><p>Axl surrendered to tears, having brushed with Death for the second time in two weeks.</p><p>The party’s emotional outbursts were cut short by strange white rats attempting to climb their legs. Several young polyps had also gained independence and scurried to the site of the action. They feasted on the remaining supplies and chunks of mole flesh.</p><p>“Step on ‘em! Step on ‘em!” Floppa shouted.</p><p>All three stomped impotently on the critters. They were hard like cockroaches, and they squirt little fountains of acid as they were crushed. The trio’s feet endured so much trauma that they could hardly stand. After ten more minutes of this strenuous exercise, all of the superorganism’s agents were slain, as far as the troup knew. They fell to their knees in order to relieve their soles, and then lay on the dirt like elephant seals. Their bodies felt heavy, as though six feet of dirt had been piled on top of them. But evening was fast approaching. They would have to make haste back to Stillwater, or else they would be left in the dark.</p><p>They began their hike back home, panting and sweating and barely awake. Our heroes, emboldened by a slew of easy victories, did not anticipate the terrible threats that lay beyond the Woods. They were amateurs at the end of the day; their well-charted habitat was not a wilderness but a playground. Now the wilderness was encroaching inward, and the reality of their weakness became clear. Whether Finn was an excellent swordsman and magician, he could no longer say. The demons of the Frontier and the Down Below possessed a strength and vigor unfathomable to the lowly creature. Between the trio and their enemies lay an impassable ravine of pure might.</p><p>All was well in the end, though. They would return tomorrow and with their present knowledge tackle the blight efficiently. They only needed to pierce the polyps as soon as they were dislodged, right? Even this final candle of hope was snuffed out, for when the trio exited the ashy radius and reentered the Woods’ welcoming green roof, did a roaring and heaving noise resound behind them. The threat could not be isolated for it seemed the entire organism had awoken to the mammals’ resistance. For all the trio knew, more behemoths were gestating, and they did not intend to check. Their hike accelerated into a sprint into the safety of darkness.</p><p>They needed help. Every inhabitant of the Woods assembled in one place would still be no match for the corals. The best they could do was to dig a moat, or to erect some kind of barrier around the degradation, and to make their rites and sacrifices as frequent and opulent as possible. To kill the corals was completely out of the question, especially for commoners untrained in combat. There were a million stocks, each its own behemoth. They needed the assistance of an army, or from a being of immense power, neither of which could be found inside their familiar Forest.</p><p>Tensions were inflamed among the mammals. Finn hoped that the journey home would be silent, but Floppa spoke up anyway: “Lifeless. I’d say that monster had quite a bit of life in him.”</p><p>“Shut up! Shut up!” Finn yelled. “I’ll kill you if you open your mouth again!”</p><p>“No you won’t. I’m opening my mouth right now and you’re not doing anything.”</p><p>Finn scurried up to Floppa at once. He embraced his leg, opened his mouth as wide as possible, and with the force of a great white shark sunk all of his teeth into the cat’s tender thigh. Floppa shouted and fell to the ground, and started kicking and striking Finn’s coconut head. He jabbed two fingers into Finn’s eye, but the gremlin would not let his prey go for even a second. They continued to wrestle and roll around in the dirt, and covered themselves in twigs and stickers. Axl watched this pathetic display from the sidelines, realizing that the inhabitants of this paradise were not as civilized as he had thought.</p><p>The pair exhausted themselves and relinquished each other. They got up, exchanged a few weak slaps that were easily dodged, and the fight was over. Thick blood trickled from Floppa’s leg. He limped away and fished a bandage from the uneaten supplies.</p><p>“Did I really offend you that much? I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Floppa said. But he was truly thinking, <i>Finn the touchy emperor, who can’t take a bit of banter, who resorts to magic because he refuses to get his paws dirty. Warrior-poet you fancy yourself, but you’d be better off a poodle on an aristocrat’s estate. There you could sing and prance around and wave your sword like a little kid, talking to nobody; and you wouldn’t have to wonder why you’re left out of our games and weddings, or why I’m the only one in this town that gives your glamorous behind the time of day. I ought to hurl you off a cliff, you prissy devil!</i></p><p>“Let’s shake,” Floppa pleaded. They did so. Finn was shivering and grunting with every breath, and he refused to look Floppa in the eye. The feline complained one last time, “I don’t think I can make it back with this injury,” but he was ignored. The rest of the way was silent as Finn had wanted.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/xiii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xi"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/xii","query":{},"buildId":"hYh6gymmZSqU8L7IIxROo","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
