Hidden server rooms chugged and heated up like furnaces. Lamps flickered and transformers sparked. The entire energistic hypergraph was illuminated with Yammi’s love and care. From a high balcony or sheet metal rooftop, one could see the colossal ellipsoid exterior of The Cocoon, before which the surrounding shantytowns and megacomplexes faded into a homogenous grayness. Red and pink clouds cloaked the city in perpetual dimness.
