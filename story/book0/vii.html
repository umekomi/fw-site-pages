Team Spaces were not places of “work” or “labor;” they were sanctuaries where people volunteered to perform tasks in exchange for a special allowance. Most of the city was unemployed and subsisted on no more than what Yammi would apportion them. As for the employed, their tasks could be divided into three categories: maintenance and replacement of energistic components; Conflict Resolution, which was a synonym for social work; and Research and Development. These sectors were further divided into teams, which occupied each Team Space. There were also special functions, reserved only for Yammi’s most beloved: running the morgues, the incubators, and The Cocoon.</p><p>Axl originally performed maintenance and replacement. His role was very hands-off: pushing buttons and watching bumps appear on a wall of slime, which supposedly encoded the state of the hypergraph. He only did it, after much provocation from Yammi, to combat the boredom of his bed.</p><p>About a month after the night of the party, Yammi assigned Axl to another team. Axl now waited in the foyer of another Village, where he would be introduced to his new job.</p><p>This Village was peculiar in that it bore no windows and was disconnected from the rest of the network, possessing a single ground-level entrance. The brick monolith was no doubt a giant R&amp;D Team Space. Yammi wanted her new ideas to be kept secret. The researchers at these facilities could be better described as lab rats, and Yammi the actual “developer.”</p><p>Axl saw somebody approach whose appearance, once ascertained, caused a flurry of confusion and self-doubt. <i>There’s no way - it’s Damien!</i></p><p>“Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you, buddy!”</p><p>He looked different this time. His head and shoulders were covered in rashes, scars, and eczema. His hairline was even more pronounced. His expression was timid and his voice softer. His gait was awkward and lopsided. Axl was legitimately elated to see him, and stretched out his arms.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t do hugs anymore. They chafe a bit too much.”</p><p>“I–I thought...”</p><p>“You thought I was dead, didn’t you? Well, Yammi, in her infinite love, saw that there was hope for me yet, that I could redeem myself, and ultimately chose mercy. She replaced the false self that sought destruction and misery with my true self, who only nourishes and empowers. Isn’t that lovely?”</p><p>Axl didn’t understand a word he said, but was happy that he had apparently changed for the better.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s really sweet. It’s great to see you again.”</p><p>“You too, Axl. Follow me, and I’ll explain what you’ll be doing here.”</p><p>They walked into the core of the complex. Every stretch of hallway was guarded by a locked door, which opened once the cameras recognized Damien. There were no corals in this building, nor sloping floors, nor dangling wires, nor dislodged ceiling tiles. Everything was impeccably maintained.</p><p>“This team is special, Axl. The technology here is so cutting-edge that Yammi won’t tell us what it is. I only have lists of instructions to follow. You will be living here for the duration of your term and you will not have internet access. Some of your belongings may be delivered if they are determined not to be a security risk.”</p><p>“No one told me about having to live here.” Axl envisioned his cozy Private Space, and how he would long for it during his stay.</p><p>“That’s because we didn’t want you to refuse working here. Yammi was very particular about her test subjects this time. Again, I’m as ignorant as you are. As always, you ought to trust her regardless of your personal biases.”</p><p>Damien led Axl to a room with a single chair, facing what looked to be a projector atop a stack of attenuators. Two tower loudspeakers sat at either side. Their diaphragms were the size of bicycle wheels.</p><p>“In front is a window into the control room, where I administer the tests. Another thing I forgot to mention: these tests are time-sensitive. While stringent hours are generally considered a no-no, we must make an exception this time. In fact, we will administer the first test right now.”</p><p>Axl nodded. Damien sat him on the chair and strapped an array of suction cups to his bulbous head. Then he went to the other side of the window and began communicating through an intercom.</p><p>“I’m beginning to think I talk too much. Is that true, Axl? Do I talk too much? I hope I’m not bombarding you with information.”</p><p>Axl did not know the proper amount of information with which to bombard someone, but he did not care. He liked when Damien talked to him, even though his voice was squeaky and he used the nickname &quot;buddy.” But Axl also wondered why Damien enjoyed his company, given how little his kindness was reciprocated.</p><p>Damien continued. “One more thing: I must ask for your explicit verbal consent before beginning the test. Judging by the setup, it looks like Yammi is improving her Laser Transformation Therapy. But whether the test is fully understood or a total mystery, consent is always a must. So do you agree to be the subject of this test?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It has to be a yes or no.”</p><p>“Yes, I consent to the test.”</p><p>“Good! Some say that asking for consent is the most joyous experience two people can share. So thank you for sharing this moment with me, Axl.”</p><p>Axl couldn’t help but blush and smile a bit. He felt all warm and fluttery inside, and his heart wouldn’t sit still. <i>This is what a friend feels like. This is how Yammi wants everyone to feel.</i> He tensed up at the memory of the night he threw that terrible fit.</p><p>“All you have to do right now, Axl, is relax.”</p><p>Damien turned down the lights. The testing room was awash in wavering scarlet that mimicked the procession of the clouds outside. The projector fired the same beam cast by the marker-sized Changing Lasers. The speakers emitted frequencies imperceptible to Axl except as faint rumblings and small changes in the stuffiness of the room.</p><p>That was, until a subtle bright ringing arose in Axl’s ears. His brain began to rattle within his skull. The various hummings and tappings of the building became more pronounced. He could feel the vibrations sweep across his body and resonate with his organs. These were not the symptoms of a normal transformation. Nevertheless, a gentle, airy tranquility settled within Axl. He merged into the atmosphere of the room. Then the room, walls, and entire city felt similarly vaporous.</p><p>Through the walls, Axl could see the city’s multitudes roving ant-like through a maze of circuitous lanes and passages. Pillars of rarified light shown from their bodies, which twinkled and breathed and sent coded messages. Axl looked closer, and found an even greater number of tiny flames - one for every insect, plant, brick, and pebble. The city was a continuum of ethereal glow that heaved like swelling waves.</p><p>Axl was surprised to find that Yammi did not exist in this world of souls. He expected her to permeate the space with some tenuous brightness, but besides the pillars there were only the shadows of material forms. Damien’s light was the closest and brightest. Axl called out to him, “Damien! Damien!” Without the slightest delay, a message appeared in his mind: “Please don’t talk during the test.”</p><p>The lights dimmed and the shadows vanished. The darkness disoriented Axl, for there was no longer up nor down in this world. Neither were there height, width, and depth; “dimensionality” does not exist in the void.</p><p>Axl was lonelier than he had ever been. For all he knew, this place of nothingness would be his eternity. But he did not fret. He settled into a state of absolute contentment, and as his mind approached complete inaction, entities of an even more rarified nature were revealed to inhabit the nothingness.</p><p>Shades, whisps, and spirits swam through the aether like deep sea microbes. They tickled Axl with a million tiny sensations. He looked down at his body and found that he was still his pink, tubular self.</p><p>The microbes’ serene dance inspired another new feeling. They possessed a strange power that left Axl awestruck, but did not intimidate him. They were at once grandiose and approachable; pleasant, but with an air of sternness and dignity. He knew somehow that these were wise creatures, and that they should be protected and cherished. Axl recognized this feeling from accounts of psychedelic trips. It had been described to him as “like getting aroused but without the boner.” He would later come to know it by the name <i>beauty</i>.</p><p>After admiring the creatures, a sudden shift in perception rapt Axl from his restfulness. The microbes congealed and solidified. The entire space condensed into a viscous, soupy mixture, and then froze entirely. Axl was bound and suffocated in an expanse of black stone extending infinitely in all directions. Only now did he grasp the existential severity of his situation. He was transported to a strange realm to be forever entombed in blackness. He wanted to scream, but the rocky material filled his mouth and lungs.</p><p>However, to Axl’s relief, even this state did not last. The stone expanse faded into differentiated forms. Axl could breathe again, and he saw the shadows of a new world manifest from the darkness.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/viii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/vi"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/vii#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/vii","query":{},"buildId":"VTrip7zn8hxOGZ8uOyB00","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
