Every brick laid in Yammi’s Radiant City was imperfect in its own way. Brittle, irregular, and rife with pores, a strong blow could knock one from its place. Indeed, every wall had a hole that let the sickening wind in. Loose cables, leakage, and haphazard plastering jobs abounded. Buildings sloped by a few stories along their axes.
