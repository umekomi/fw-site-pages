When I first decided to write, I wanted to draw from my own experiences. As a result, the whole piece reeks of modern sensibilities and modern anxieties. The subject matter is mopey and political. I have no real problems in life; hence the problems in the book are fake and gay. By injecting my attitudes and neuroses into the work, and by turning the characters into mouthpieces for my psyche, I’ve created something very insular, egocentric, and infantile; something that discounts the totality of human experience, and amounts to holding a megaphone up to the reader’s ear and shouting about my feelings.</p><p>Somewhere along the line I decided I just wanted to write about cute animals. I wanted to present an aesthetic; not <i>ideas</i>. If entertainment in the twenty-first century has taught us anything, it’s that escapism and power fantasies are far superior to lectures, sob stories, and works that “really make you think.” Thus my goal became to cram all of the dated, woe-is-me stuff into Book 0, and to save the whimsy and preciousness for when the project <i>really</i> began. The reason why there is so much dialogue in Book 0 is that I had too much to “get over with.” By the time Finn and Axl left the treehouse for good, I still had more to say, so I wrote a twenty page author’s note in which I wax philosophic and lambast myself for being a massive nerd. I was banking on the author’s notes developing into some kind of meta plotline, but I had no good ideas. Last night I attempted to incorporate the themes of the rant into a Book 0 Epilogue, but the scene with the duo in the treehouse was too much of a natural stopping point. One of the themes of the rant was getting over yourself and not getting caught up in words and mantras. Oh, the irony.</p><p>I’ve spent months ruminating over how to stuff every little lesson into Book 0, and I am exhausted. So I am drawing the line. With this author’s note, Book 0 will be finished for good, and I’ll be able to move onto greater things. It’s a shame because the twenty page diatribe had some killer lines. What’s more, I’ve introduced so many loose ends that the mundanity of Book 0 will have to reappear eventually. I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.</p><p>The remainder of FriendWorld will differ from Book 0, both plot-wise and tone-wise. My focus will shift entirely to creating something timeless, wholesome, beautiful, and life-affirming. I can’t guarantee that I’ll succeed, though.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p><i>- Umekomi</i></p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/credits"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/xiii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/an#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/an","query":{},"buildId":"oLl5wrKd3EesXbR2oZ03g","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
