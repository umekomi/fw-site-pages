He was looking out into a blurry beige place. The shadow of a giant loomed past and drove him back into his purple cave. He woke up under the covers. The nightmare made him queasy. Despite yesterday’s frightful ordeal, during which he dangled from the precipice of life, all of back-home’s stresses surfaced like Atlantis’s bleak carcass out of the ocean’s black surface. </p><p>When the evil thoughts died down, a more immediate matter occupied Axl’s mind: this bed was not his. He lay in a circular chamber lined with overflowing bookshelves and Gothic windows large enough for ghosts to float through, and wooden desks and wardrobes on which sat curious instruments, totems, lanterns, and other shiny and delicate objects of spiritual significance. Every angle was replete with intricate carvings and joinery, self-similar geometry, and perennial symbolism. The muted morning rays showing through the curtains projected elegant floral patterns onto the walls. Everything was tinted in a tender peach color, which reminded Axl of a nursery. The ceiling was a giant sloping hibiscus petal, resting gently on the structure like fabric and drenching the room with its tropical hues, saturated beyond what the human eye can appreciate. The place was a visual feast for Axl, who had only seen this level of ornamentation in the gaudy classrooms of his youth.</p><p>He kicked off the covers like a little boy, now in a serene mood. But when he tried to roll off the bed, the events of last night came rushing back. There was no arm left - only a bandage. It looked like a hole in a steel barrel that had been duct-taped. Axl let out shrieks of horror and fruitlessly shook the phantom limb. Then the door to the bedroom swung open, and an unfamiliar face hurried in.</p><p>He was short and stocky and sky-blue. Ginormous eyes with small oval pupils and green irises occupied his entire face. Thick flaps of a majestic blue rested on either side of his skull. He wore nothing but a fancy red scarf. His tiny nostrils flared, and his lip lifted to reveal, aside from the two outward-sticking dagger-like fangs, an entire row of formidable blades. Axl half expected that his other arm would end up in the creature’s maw.</p><p>The thing shoved Axl back in bed and began chirping in hymns and birdsong. Then, realizing that he was not understood, he began speaking in a grosser tongue.</p><p>“Lizard friend, you should go back to bed.”</p><p>Axl obeyed and the carpet-skinned creature tucked him in.</p><p>“Back to sleep! I will come up with breakfast.”</p><p>The creature left and Axl stared at the ceiling completely awake. It returned and set a mug of coffee on the nightstand, and a plate of eggs and sausages on Axl’s lap.</p><p>“What is your name, Mister Lizard?” he asked.</p><p>“Axl.”</p><p>“And what were you doing in my Woods?”</p><p>Axl stared confusedly at the inquisitive creature. Being put on the spot was another stressor of his. “What was I doing...?”</p><p>“You are a Blueblood, yes? I already know where you came from. My question is how you got here.”</p><p>How could Axl have answered, having not even heard the word “woods” before? He tried nonetheless.</p><p>“Damien was doing a test on me, and I ended up in this place. And then I was attacked by...” He began to tear up, because he foresaw that his missing arm would be a life-long burden. But wait - Yammi could give it back. He could get a Change done! His fears were dispelled for the time being.</p><p>“Who’s Damien?” asked the creature.</p><p>“My team leader and Character Counselor.”</p><p>“You speak a lot of nonsense, Mister Lizard. Are you not in pain? My doctor doesn’t know how to treat Bluebloods.”</p><p>Axl felt only a dull soreness in the site of the wound. He didn’t comprehend the agony that the loss of a limb would cause other animals.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Fine, you say? All right. My name is Finn, and I’m in charge of these parts. You are very privileged to be here, Mister Lizard. None of your kind has ventured up to the In Between in millenia. I will let you stay for a while, but you will be my prisoner. Don’t worry, I won’t lock you up and torture you! Hahaha.”</p><p>Axl did not know whether to take the joke seriously. The words came at him all at once, as they do from a figure in a dream. </p><p>“Who was the person who tore my arm off?”</p><p>“You tell me. Did he have a long snout like this?” He curled his fingers and held them to his nostrils like he was holding a soda can.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then it was a <i>mammoth wolfbear</i>, in which case you are lucky to be alive. Methinks the Forest has taken a liking to you, or She just wanted you to stop peeing on Her shrubs!”</p><p>“If you’re in charge, can you-” Axl remembered to use polite language. “May you please do something about him?”</p><p>“Do what? Track down a wolfbear and book him? You crack me up, Mister Lizard!”</p><p>Axl finished eating while Finn watched. The food was succulent and filled him with energy.</p><p>“I want to get up now,” Axl said.</p><p>“And go where?”</p><p>“To my room.”</p><p>“This is your room for now.”</p><p>“When can I go back?”</p><p>“When you are no longer useful to me.”</p><p>Finn wrapped his dainty claws around Axl’s still-attached hand and helped him up. The bedroom door opened directly to a hanging bridge, which delved into an endless volume of webbed, sunlit leaves and serpentine branches. The creature’s dwelling was a pair of wooden structures nestled in a wide, purple-barked oak. They re-entered into the kitchen where Axl’s breakfast was made.</p><p>“Lizard, do you want to see a magic trick?”</p><p>Axl agreed. Without the slightest intermission, all of the drawers and cabinet doors opened. The stray utensils, ingredients, and china levitated and returned effortlessly to their proper places, and all of the scraps and crumbs were collected and disposed of. Finn did not lift a finger, and awaited Axl’s astonishment with a smirk.</p><p>“How did you do that?” Axl exclaimed.</p><p>“Tee-hee, that is my secret! But let this be a warning never to cross me.”</p><p>Finn led Axl out of the treehouse and handed him the Hawaiian shirt that had been drying. Now that Axl was in a clear state of mind, he could appreciate the immeasurable beauty of his new world: the iridescent clouds that floated in the heavens like the thrones of solar gods, the adorable critters that scurried in the undergrowth, and the humongous trees that Axl still knew as the pillars of a great temple. If religion had still existed in Yammi’s city, this place would be instantly recognized as Eden.</p><p>They walked down a grassy trail. Along the way, Finn would point to various sights and sounds and say, “Look at that! What do you think, lizard?” He picked flowers and berries and held them to Axl’s nose and mouth. As enraptured as Axl was at the myriad delights, his face and voice did not betray much enthusiasm. Finn dragged Axl by the hand once more and hummed a little ditty about how lizards are so serious.</p><p>They reached the settlement where Axl had passed out the night before, which was called Stillwater. It was a modestly sized town, quiet, self-contained, and self-satisfied. However, every structure was an elite specimen of woodworking and masonry, adorned with royal balconies, bright colors, and pagan flourishes. Nature climbed up the walls and enveloped the buildings, bringing the village into sublime communion with the Woods. Vegetable gardens grew abundantly in front of every abode, and trees stood unperturbed even in the town’s center, providing the children with cool shade under which they played pretend. </p><p>Axl was brought to the square where the village met the river. “Introduce yourself to my subjects,” Finn commanded. “Tell them that you’re a foreigner, and that you’re staying here temporarily, and buy some painkiller from the apothecary if you need it.” He handed the salamander a few bronze coins.</p><p>“You’re leaving me?” Axl said.</p><p>“Are you weary? Do you need to go back to bed?”</p><p>“No, no. It’s just that-”</p><p>“So long, then! Return to me later, and I’ll have you do chores around the house, lizard friend.” The creature skipped away, leaving Axl with the distressing task of saying hi to strangers.</p><p>The town was quiet, and the figures that Axl saw looked preoccupied. Only mammals of temperate climes dwelled here: foxes, deer, rodents, and the like. Axl looked like a common bum roaming and milling about. Shaven bodies were somewhat of a taboo here. He was receiving suspicious looks and couldn’t gather the courage to initiate a conversation. Mercifully, a perplexed but well-intentioned family of foxes approached him.</p><p>“Sir, are you lost?” said the father. “There’s an inn down there.” He pointed in the direction of the square. The mother quietly distracted the cubs so that they wouldn’t gawk at the weird shaved man.</p><p>Axl recited the Finn’s words verbatim: “I’m Axl. I’m a foreigner who’s staying here temporarily.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, how do you do. Like I said...” The fox pointed more forcefully. “Inn, inn! Do you need a place to stay?”</p><p>“No,” Axl replied. “I’m staying with Finn.”</p><p>“Finn?” The husband and wife looked at each other and shook their heads in mutual confoundment. “Why are you walking around, then?”</p><p>Axl remembered the second half of his assignment. “I’m looking for the ap...the acop...the apo-”</p><p>“The apothecary?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It’s right by the inn.”</p><p>Axl returned to the square and scoured the signs on the facades, sounding out each letter. At last, he discovered the fabled apothecary.</p><p>The place was staffed by Kirby, a brown goat in overalls. Her hair was braided luxuriously and tied up with cute bows. She caught Axl wandering aimlessly about the shelves and asked, “May I help you?” Having never seen nor heard a woman before, Axl’s first thought was, <i>He sounds just like Yammi!</i></p><p>“I’m looking for painkiller.”</p><p>“I should think so! How did you lose it?” she said, staring at Axl’s missing arm.</p><p>“It was bitten off by...something with a big nose.”</p><p>“Wow! You ought to watch your back around these parts. Lots of dangerous critters that’ll snap you in half. You wouldn’t want to leave the Woods...<i>unarmed!</i> Sorry, I couldn’t help myself.”</p><p>The goat handed Axl a bottle of ointment. To her confusion, the strange pink blobby creature said nothing more and left without paying. He moseyed out into the square, oblivious. The goat pharmacist approached from behind and struck him with a fire iron, sending him to the pavement.</p><p>“We don’t tolerate thieves in this town!” she yelled, and gave the curled up salamander a sharp kick. “Go back to where you came from, you bald, stinky foreigner!”</p><p>The ointment bottle had shattered and oozed between the cobbles. Kirby noticed three bronze coins strewn on the ground, picked them up, and returned to the store.</p><p>Axl was half-tempted to run back into the Woods to be eaten by another wolf monster. He was deathly afraid of what Finn might do to him if he returned without the medicine. Unfortunately, the strange creature with ominous powers was Axl’s only source of shelter. He started back to the treehouse, but had forgotten the way.</p><p>While wandering, he passed by another person tending to his front garden. He was an all-white bull terrier. His head was shaped like the cone of an aircraft, with rosyness all around his snout. His eyes were black and tiny like Axl’s, and he sported a pipe, a monocle, and a plaid jacket, clearly an old-timer.</p><p>Axl hid from the dog’s sight line while he prepared his approach. Before he could formulate the conversation in his mind, he saw that the subject was finished with his work and was about to head inside. Axl sped over with a thin veneer of confidence and said, “H-hi.”</p><p>“Hey. What can I do for you?” said the dog.</p><p>“I’m Axl. I’m a foreigner who’s staying here temporarily.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Axl. The name’s Walter. I’m the mayor of this town.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“It means that I’m in charge ‘round here.”</p><p>“I thought Finn was in charge.”</p><p>“Finn!” Walter chuckled. “Finn is a madman. He talks to birds and trees and other inanimate objects. He calls himself the Emperor of the Woods, and we’re all his subjects, apparently.”</p><p>“So both of you are mayor?”</p><p>“No! I’m the only mayor!” Walter expelled some phlegm with a few wet coughs. “Finn is a lunatic and a scoundrel, and if it weren’t for his strange gifts, I would’ve gotten some buddies together and surrounded his house with pitchforks.”</p><p>Before Axl could ask what Finn did to warrant such animosity, Walter indulged him.</p><p>“He’s holding our town hostage, damnit! He’s a complainer, first and foremost. He complains that our festivals don’t feature athletic games, that the idols in our homes are for decoration and not worship, that we don’t bury the dead the right way, that we don’t show enough love to the Woods, or to other gods. When we work, he bids us to rest, and when we rest, he bids us to work. Some are entranced by his contradictions, and they think, <i>Do I listen to the dumb old dog or to the funny magic man?</i> But most of us see him for the pompous firestarter he is, and would rather he shut up.”</p><p>At this point, Axl could not help but agree with Walter. <i>I don’t want to worship anyone!</i> he thought. <i>And I suck at games, so I don’t want to participate in them.</i> On the other hand, he saw nothing wrong with complaining in general. If one has a grievance to share, what other course of action is there to take?</p><p>“Lemme tell you a story,” Walter said. “We were performing our rites for...umm, the spring equinox? Doesn’t matter. We found the most beautiful, silvery doe in the Woods, and had it tied to the pyre. We used to decapitate our sacrifices first, but we figured that the entire animal - body and soul - should float upward at the same time; and the more the animal suffers, the bigger the sacrifice, amirite? We thought Finn would appreciate these details.</p><p>“So we’re all ready, but just as the pyre was set ablaze, Finn ran in there like a child, yellin’ somethin’ along the lines of...” He imitated Finn in a shrill tone: “‘Stop! Don’t hurt her! Oh, you killers! You should all be burning instead!’ He’s very dramatic, y’see? He tried to pry off the doe, but was set ablaze himself. He rolled around in the dirt, and then he sped like a comet toward the river and doused himself. I hate to admit it, but a few of us were trying to keep our laughter in. I mean, he’s this four-foot tall devil who had been annoying us for a long time, and it seemed he finally got his comeuppance. His one friend freed the doe anyway cause he felt bad, and everyone left frustrated cause we had spent so much time setting up. </p><p>“He came out of the water lookin’ like a hairball. His fur was black for a week, until he caved and shaved it off. He hardly left his home in the meantime. Once his fur grew back, though, he reverted to his usual, pompous self. He didn’t even apologize for the whole ordeal. We have a running joke in the town, now, that he retreats into the Woods to have relations with that doe.”</p><p>Walter’s anecdote left a sour taste in Axl’s mouth. Did they at least ask the doe before burning it alive? This practice of “sacrifice” felt very wrong and violent, but Walter spoke so casually and authoritatively that Axl decided not to question it. <i>The people here are very smart,</i> he thought. <i>They wouldn’t kill someone without their consent.</i></p><p>The dog capstoned his speech: “We are a simple, contented folk. We have homes, families, a lovely community...nothing to add. This town doesn&#x27;t need no wizards or sorcerers or emperors, or whatever magical folk call themselves these days. He protects the Woods from demons, so says he. I say he brings them over here! His art is only good for lifting things and killing people. Well, we got hands for that!”</p><p>“How does he do his magic tricks?” Axl inquired. “He wouldn’t tell me.”</p><p>“Hell if I know,” said Walter. “And if it’s his secret, then I ain’t tellin’ anyway, cause he’d use that magic to rip my head clean off. I’d still put him to sleep if we threw hands like gentlemen.” He coughed again. Then he leaned into Axl as if he were indeed telling a secret. “I wouldn’t let him touch you anywhere on your body, son. I heard he reads minds that way.”</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/fw_old/x"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/fw_old/viii"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/writing"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/fw_old/ix#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/fw_old/ix","query":{},"buildId":"Xo3LsHYNaAUMTxkA3Fqks","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
