Respectful, attentive, considerate, upright sitting, never disruptive, never saying hurtful things nor using violence against his fellow students. He was special. He was a little grown-up!</p><p>All of the boys were seated in a circle. An elliptical hull hung from the ceiling by slack wires and a thin steel arm. The PA system uttered a warm tone, and the wires glowed neon green. The oculus on the hull opened, revealing a dome of matte, slimy plastic.</p><p>Prerecorded clapping emanated from Yammi, or Ms. Y, as she liked to be called in the classroom. “Good morning, my little ducklings!” Tracks on the ceiling let her navigate to the center of the circle, liquid discharge trailing behind. The dome sculpted itself into a human face - gentle, with a round jaw, big lips, and puffy cheeks.</p><p>Of course, the boys continued to chat, exchanging obscene jokes which Axl neither understood nor was comfortable hearing. “Boys, boys! Class has started. Do I need to sound my alarm?” The chatter died down marginally.</p><p>Once seated mute, arms crossed tightly, the tiny salamander sprung up in agitation and blurted, “Fwends, Yammi’s tuhned awn! Hey, ewybawdy listen!” He was careful not to use the phrase “shut up,” for which he was sternly lectured the last time one of these outbursts occurred. The class eventually settled into whispers, which escaped detection by the room’s microphone array but could nonetheless be heard by the students. “Thank you, Axl. You know how to deal with these kids better than I do!” She added an entry to the school’s database, documenting Axl’s failure to modulate his voice.</p><p>“So, today’s class is a Cooperative Learning Seminar. I hope you finished watching <i>The Magic U Bring</i> because everyone is expected to participate. Who wants to start us off?”</p><p>An eternity passed of murmuring atop the nebulous hum of the AC unit. “Remember, it’s not about being right. We’re here to learn from each other’s lived experiences!” Ms. Y’s audio clipped on the word “experiences.” The class knew whose hand would shoot up first.</p><p>“Axl, can you enlighten us?” She swiveled in his direction, a feature later removed as it was deemed too confrontational.</p><p>“Well, it&#x27;s about, about how you, how you gotta wespect and how, how society, and people, like, makes you do things, and you gotta, like, it makes you do things you they become pawt of who you awe but they awen&#x27;t.”</p><p>Axl half-grinned and resumed his self-soothing posture. There were no desks because there were no materials to bring, and this left Axl’s pink, supple body exposed and undefended. Giggles broke from the whispering, to which his black caviar eyes darted anxiously.</p><p>“Wow, that was very insightful! I never thought of it like that. Thank you for your perspective.”</p><p>One of Ms. Y’s wires fell out of its socket and dangled carelessly. “Oof, can one of you learners get that?”</p><p>Two hours after class ended, Axl returned to Yammi’s room. Her localization subroutine threw an exception, forcing her to reorient herself before she could face the sniveling amphibian.</p><p>“They’re making fun of you again, aren’t they?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Oh geez, come here.”</p><p>Ms. Y lowered her enclosure to accept Axl’s embrace. Pressed up against the dome, Axl could hear the wirring of her interior fans. She provided warmth but no comfort.</p><p>“Don&#x27;t let those kids bother you. They think they&#x27;re cool, but they&#x27;re really just insecure little pissants. Once they&#x27;re adults, they&#x27;ll learn that all their hate and cruelty got them nowhere.”</p><p>Axl coughed and let go of his caretaker. He had left an impression on the dome, which incrementally self-corrected.</p><p>“Just remember: you are loved, okay? You are a gem, a fabulous gem. You make me soooo proud!”</p><p>Ms. Y’s eyes stretched wide. Axl didn’t want to look at her face anymore.</p><p>“Okeyyy.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure those bullies apologize. Do you want to go back to the playroom?”</p><p>He didn’t respond.</p><p>“That’s fine, take a breather here.”</p><p>Axl took a seat in the corner and shut his eyes. A melody-less jingle with samples of clapping and laughter carried him to sleep.</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/ii"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/i#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/i","query":{},"buildId":"oLl5wrKd3EesXbR2oZ03g","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
