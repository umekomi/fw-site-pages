Nominally, the residents of the slums were no worse off than their counterparts in the Villages, since Yammi assigned Private Spaces to everyone in the city.</p><p>All was cloaked in shadow besides the weak glow of green lamps. Makeshift structures ten stories high overhung the streets like the watery vaults of Zion Canyon. The ground was damp and smelled like sewage, and the corals sprung from every crevice. Dense wires crisscrossed every alley and intersection, presenting the risk of electrocution.</p><p>Axl made this commute many times a week, but never felt safe in the slums. Every puddle splash or tapping of metal caused him to jump. Every approach from a bigger, stronger man made his gills perk up, although this was true even in the Villages.</p><p>Today, Axl’s fears would be confirmed. As preoccupied as ever, his breath was suddenly stolen by a quick shove from the rear that sent him tumbling to the ground. The group of marauders - a human, a fish, and a shrimp-like creature - pawed him up and down. Taking only Damien’s booklet, they began kicking and laughing and shouting expletives while Axl assumed the fetal position. Then they ran off, yipping and howling into the night. Their hysterics echoed through the streets and continued to traumatize Axl as he lay sobbing in the mud.</p><p>These were the exuberant murderers to whom killing was like throwing stones, the savages who enjoyed the act of domination. Axl had already encountered these folks before - at the party, during his every commute, at the lounge, and at his Team Space. Every waking hour, there were more obstacles to be avoided, more loud and radiant figures sent to intimidate and belittle him with their auras of confidence, and to delight in his inferiority. All part of the Mad God’s torture regimen! Axl resolved to take Damien’s advice: he would <i>never</i> be like them, nor would he associate with them.</p><p>He got up, eventually. His green Hawaiian shirt with orange flowers was caked in goo. It was the only article of clothing that Yammi had given him. On his way home, he passed by digital signs which read, &quot;Think before you speak.&quot;</p></article><br/><div class="StoryFooter_storyfooter__msB3Z"><a href="/story/book0/vi"><button type="submit" class="blue">Next</button></a><a href="/story/book0/iv"><button type="submit" class="pink">Previous</button></a><a href="/story/contents"><button type="submit" class="b">Contents</button></a><a href="/story/book0/v#top"><button type="submit" class="w">Back to Top</button></a></div><br/><br/></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/story/book0/v","query":{},"buildId":"Ti1KVfA8PZBjYVLMpc9G7","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
